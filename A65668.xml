            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE Judicious Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Subject matters treated of in theſe Eſſayes are confeſſedly weighty and important: ſomethings in them, it muſt be acknowledged to many, if not to moſt in this age will ſeem new, and at leaſt, before a through weighing of the whole, and diligent collation of one thing with another, ſomewhat ſtrange; and no wonder, ſeeing none of late have profeſſedly handled the two former queſtions (wherein what is dubious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to cenſure will eſpecially be found) here diſcuſſed. Whence I cannot but expect that ſome, poſſibly not a few, ſo ſoon as they underſtand how high I have carried the priviledges of the ſeed of Believers, and how great a good I have aſſigned to them, and that univerſally, will reject the whole as novel, unſound and erroneous, though upon no other account than the different apprehenſions themſelves have hitherto had together with a prejudicate perſwaſion of the impoſſibility of yeelding ſo much to the Seed of Believers, and that univerſally, and yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe great doctrines of Election, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So long contended for by the generality of Proteſtants. To ſuch I have little to ſay, ſave only to aſſure them that I hold, and am ready, according to that ſmall Talent I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb facs="tcp:106622:3"/>to contend with them for thoſe, Doctrines, as to the Sum and Subſtance of them, that they are juſtly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of having any breach made upon, and had I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended any inconſiſtency between what is here offered and thoſe Doctrines, theſe Papers had never ſeen the Light: But as for others, who by humility, ſence of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſciouſneſs to themſelves of not having made ſo thorow an inquiry into theſe matters as may be made, are kept apprehenſive of a poſſibility of receiving an addition to that light they have received about them; I hope I may without offence humbly recommend theſe Eſſayes to their ſerious peruſal, not deſiring a ſudden complyance from any; that a through-ſearch be made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is here offered, and things duely compared the one with the other, is all that I expect. That ſome Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays of this nature ſhould be made ſeems neceſſary, it being ſufficiently known by all how great a let to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement and comfortable walking in the practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm the want of a ſatisfactory reſolution of theſe queſtions hath been and ſtill is. What more frequent in the mouths of the unwary rejectors of that practice than ſuch queſtions as theſe? For what reaſon can it be imagined, that God ſhould appoint ſuch a ſolemn and weighty Ordinance as that of Baptiſm is, to be applyed to Ignorant Babes, who can make no uſe or improvement of it? or what good have they by it? or if we will aſſign any good to them that is worth contending for, how can we maintain thoſe doctrines of Election and ſpecial Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſo zealouſly aſſert? The removal of of which ſtumbling-blocks ſeems neceſſary, and is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. That the Infant-Seed of believing Parents are intereſted in the Covenant of Grace, or are confederaies with their Parents, and have a right to the token of the Covenant, which now is Baptiſm, are here taken for
<pb facs="tcp:106622:3"/>granted, and lie as the Foundation to the enſuing diſcourſe: and indeed both theſe now appear with ſo much clearneſs of evidence, and meet with ſuch feeble oppoſition from Men contrary-minded, that I cannot ſee how any can rationally expect the further eſtabliſhment of either, but may juſtly expect we ſhould build upon thoſe Foundations laid. And to nothing can the ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs of the generality of judicious Chriſtians, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned or unlearned, in their Judgments and Practices reſpective to the Covenant-Intereſt and Baptiſm of the Infants we ſpeak of, be ſo properly, and according to any principles of Chriſtianity, attributed on this ſide the watchfull eye of the great Shepherd of the Flock, as to the clearneſs of that evidence, eſpecially conſidering how little inquiry hath been made into, and how little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction hath been given about the queſtion here debated. Neither ought nor rationally can any different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions diſcernable about the reſolution of theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein the ſtructure to be raiſed doth conſiſt, be interpreted as a weakning to the Foundation laid, though ſuch an evil conſtruction is put upon them by ſome. For my ſelf, however I may be apprehended, by ſuch eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that ſtand aloof off, and view my work at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to have built but Hay and Stubble; yet upon a through ſcrutiny and juſt trial I cannot but hope, yea, and am greatly perſwaded, it will be found what will abide the Fire. Indeed in my ſearch after the good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and advantages accruing to the Seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by their Covenant-Intereſt and Baptiſm, I have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in a Path much unfrequented of latter years by the Foot of Man, and have ſeen many dangerous Rocks and Precipices both on my right hand and on my left, and that not at a great diſtance only, but very near, which how to avoid I muſt ſay hath coſt me ſome ſerious
<pb facs="tcp:106622:4"/>thoughts: beſides my way hath been not a little obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and obſtructed, by the various croſs traverſings to and fro both by Friends and Foes. Yet I hope through the good hand of God upon me, and that light be hath afforded me, my way is ſafe; Yet this I ſhall freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg? 'tis not onlypoſſible, but very probable that ſuch as ſhall adventure into this ſearch, will diſcern my ſteps have unt been ſo even, but that they will ſee it neceſſary ſometimes to tread out of the very Steps that I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: yet this I am much perſwaded of, that as they will find the Good, Benefits and Priviledges aſſigned by me to the Seed of Believers, do indeed appertain unto them; ſo they muſt walk at leaſt very nigh the Path I have gone in, Yet I ſhall not be poſitive and peremptory, that the Infant Seed of Believers can have no intereſt in the Covenant, nor right to Baptiſm, unleſs they are granted to have all that good, and all thoſe benefits and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that I have aſſigned to them; much leſs will I ſay that no other mediums-can be found out to evince the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary redundancy of all that good, and all thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Priviledges from their Covenant-ſtate and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than what I have made uſe of; only this I muſt ſay, I cannot at preſent ſee how we can maintain the former, and not grant the latter. 'Tis true, the good, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Advantages I have aſſigned them are great and glorious; but the ſerious conſideration that it is a Covenant of Grace that is extended to them, and taking due meaſures of the unſearchable Riches of the Grace of God, the ſhewing forth and illuſtration of which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by his entring Covenant with Man, will be of no ſmall uſe unto any that ſhall purſue the enquiry I have entred upon. 'Tis certain, 'tis a moſt glorious expreſſion of the Grace of God, that be ſhould extend his Covenant to the ſeed of his People with themſelves, and grant ſo
<pb facs="tcp:106622:4"/>much good to them thereby, Yea I think it may be ſaid, tis one of the moſt glorious expreſſions God hath made of his Grace to Men, next to that unſpeakable Gift the Son of his Love. But ſeeing 'tis a Covenant of Grace, and God the Author of it is ſo unſearchably rich in Grace, why ſhould the Glory of it obſtruct our belief? Why ſhould it ſeem incredible, that God ſhould extend his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to Infants, and grant them all that good that hath been aſſigned freely, though themſelves are utterly uncapable of performing any duty antecedently as the condition, or conſequently immediately by way of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when where he doth impoſe a condition as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the adult, yet himſelf gives it, and what fruit of gratitude he receives, is <hi>found</hi> (as the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>in himſelf?</hi> It's true ſome of our oppoſers, to the prejudicing of their own minds, and for the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtumbling-blocks in the way of others, have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we hold the ſame conditions are incumbent upon Infants even in their Infant ſtate, that are incumbent upon the Adult, only that Parents are taken as proxies to perform the condition in the room and ſtead of their Children. A great miſtake. We ſay the Covenant is wholly free to Children during their pure Infant-ſtate, and that no condition at all is incumbent upon them, only that they be the Seed of Believers. Hence, when we ſpeak of the condition of Childrens Covenant-Intereſt, we mean no more, but that it is neceſſary that they be the Seed of Believers, the promiſes being <hi>to Abraham's Seed</hi> (and ſuch confeſſedly true Believers are,) <hi>in their Generations.</hi> And why the greatneſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Good, and thoſe Priviledges and Benefits aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to them, ſhould ſtumble any, I can ſee no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it be conſidered that it is the Covenant of Grace that is extended to them, and due meaſures of the
<pb facs="tcp:106622:5"/>Grace of God be-taken, and both conſidered in conjunction with his deſign in eſtabliſhing his Covenant with, and granting all the Grace and Bleſſings of it unto Men. Though truth, as its Author neither needs, nor is much advantaged as to its entertainment by thoſe, whoſe care it is to receive the Law from the mouth of the Supreme Law-giver by the teſtimony of Men; yet when any Man hath a Call to expoſe to publick view, what he conceives to be ſo, which carries an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of diſsonancy from the known ſentiments of the generality of Orthodox Divines contemporary with him, to evidence the correſpondency thereof with the Principles and Judgments of former Divines, of equal repute for Orthodoxy and Soundneſs in the Faith, may be uſeful, both as a means to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the cenſure of ſingularity; and what be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to view from rejection, before a through-enquiry be made into it. As for what I have aſſerted, I am willing it ſhould undergo the moſt ſevere Scrutiny by all unbyaſſed and judicious lovers of Truth, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably that it ſhould be rejected, or embraced, according to the Evidence it carries along with it. Neither ſhall I make much ſearch after the Judgment either of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern Divines; neither have I, as the Caſe at preſent ſtands with me, a convenient opportunity to do it: Yet this may be ſaid in the general, 'tis well known to all that have any conſiderable acquaintance with their Writings, that the generality, if not the univerſality of the Fathers living in the firſt Ages, did grant, yea aſſert the full of what I have done, and, as moſt think ſomewhat more; but therein I doubt not but they will be acknowledged by thoſe I have now a ſpecial reſpect unto to have exceeded the bounds of Truth, and conſequently that what they have allowed
<pb facs="tcp:106622:5"/>beyond what I have aſſerted, muſt be reckoned <hi>inter naevos.</hi> That wherein (it is true) they have declared their Judgments moſt clearly and fully in and about, is thoſe two Benefits I have aſſigned to the infant-Seed of Believers, <hi>viz.</hi> Their diſcharge from the guilt and condemning power of Original ſin, and a right to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Salvation, and conſequently their infallible enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, in caſe of their death in their pure Infant-ſtates. But they that have granted them theſe two Benefits, cannot be rationally ſuppoſed to deny the third, <hi>viz.</hi> Their intereſt and propriety in God, ſeeing pardon of ſin and propriety in God are inſeparable. And yet that they did univerſally aſſert the neceſſity of their perſonal Faith, and cloſure in with the Covenant, when come to years of maturity, is undoubted. So that, I conceive, it will be readily granted, that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the generality, if not the univerſality of the Primitive Fathers, lies on my ſide; and that wherein I diſſent from them, they themſelves diſſented from the Truth. Indeed it muſt not be denied that at leaſt too many ſeem to, poſſibly ſome really did, aſcribe theſe things too abſtractedly to Baptiſm, not having that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Covenant that they ought to have had; but that all, yea, or the major part, eſpecially in the purer Ages of the Church, did ſo, is not only more then can be proved, but the contrary may be rationally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from variety of paſſages ſcattered up and down in their Writings. As for our modern Divines, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of the preſent Age, I ſhall readily grant they have been, and ſtill are, as to the major part of them otherwiſe minded. Their miſtakes I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive need rectifying in order to a through eſtablaſhment of the minds of Men in the practice I in common with them plead for; and therefore their bare teſtimonies
<pb facs="tcp:106622:6"/>ought not to be improved againſt me. Yet I am not wholly ſingular, ſome in this preſent age, and more in the ages laſt foregoing, have ſufficiently declared their Judgments in a nigh if not exact correſpondency to what I have affirmed. The <hi>17</hi> Article of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> in their firſt bead of Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, come up fully to part of what I have affirmed, and therefore I think meet to tranſcribe it: It is this, <hi>Quandoquidem de veritate Dei ex verbo ipſius nobis eſt judicandum, quod teſtatur liberos fidelium eſſe Sanctos, non quidem naturâ, ſed beneficio foederis gratuit, in quo illi cum parentibus comprehenduntur pii parentes de Elections &amp; ſalute ſuorum liberorum, quos Deus in infantiâ ex hâc vitâ evocat, dubitare non debent.</hi> Which ſeems neceſſarily to require, as might eaſily be made out, conſidering their judgments in all thoſe five controverted points, that they ſhould hold the full of what I do. And as theſe worthy Divines expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare their Judgments to be for the Election and infallible Salvation of all the Infant-Seed of Believers dying in their Infancy; So I ſhall quote one famous in his day (to let paſs particular Divines of that Synod) exactly concurring with what I have ſaid concerning the diſcharge of all Infants we now ſpeak of from the guilt of Original Sin; that is famous <hi>Urſin; His</hi> words are theſe. <hi>Peccatum Originale in Baptiſmo formale tollitur, ſed materiale manet;</hi> that is, as himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, <hi>tollitur quoad reatum, manet quoad pravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi> Some others of the ſame mind with me as to the main Good, Benefits and Priviledges aſſigned to the ſeed of Believers might be mentioned, and a further ſearch into the Judgment of Authors concerning that way I have proceeded in, to ſecure my ſelf from thoſe Rocks bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon it, was intended; but an unexpected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
<pb facs="tcp:106622:6"/>removal of me from my ſtudy, when I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to put the laſt hand to the enſuing ſheeets, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by means whereof the Book appears more naked than otherwiſe it might have done. But to haſten. The Reader may take notice, that the firſt draught of the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here given of the two firſt queſtions was drawn up about four or five years ſince; but I was not without ſome hopes that ſome abler Pen might have performed this Work, and when I ſaw a call to it, I was willing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go <hi>gradatim</hi> than run, that I might tread more ſecurely. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon both which accounts, with ſome others, my firſt promiſe hath been ſo long unperformed, and now at laſt it being performed, I muſt ſay two things greatly check my expectations as to the deſired effects of this my undertaking.</p>
            <p>The firſt is the curſory reading and overly peruſal of Books by the generality of Readers. How few ſhall we find that will be at the paines, or allow themſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time throughly to weigh and well digeſt what they read, and with the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily, whether the things they read be ſo? How do moſt curſorily read Books coming to their hands? and if any thing appear to correſpond with their precedent ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they readily embrace that or if any thing diſagree therefrom, they as ſuddenly reject without a due weighing of what is written, and comparing one thing with another: But alas! Divine Truths, eſpecially that lie more towards the bottom of thoſe Golden Mines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures, or are obſcured by the different ſentiments and reaſonings of Men, will not be found out or diſcerned in themſelves, and diſtinguiſhed from errors at ſo eaſy a rate.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is thoſe groſs neglects, that Parents are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally guilty of towards their Children. Oh the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb facs="tcp:106622:7"/>even of their own Children that moſt Parents will be found guilty of! I mean it not of their Bodies, but of their Souls. <hi>Cauſa Cauſae eſt Cauſa Cauſati</hi> is a ſure maxim. The Apoſtacy of Children is the cauſe of their Death, but the neglect of Parents is the great cauſe of their Apoſtacy. Parents will poſſibly catch at what makes for their comfort with reference to their Children, eſpecially ſuch of them as have been either carryed from the Womb to, or taken out of the Cradle, and laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in the Grave; yet I much fear but few will be ſtirred up and effectually moved to a vigorous performance of their duty towards thoſe whoſe lives are prolonged, and that arrive to that ripeneſs of age, that capacifies them for the performance of the conditions of the Covenant themſelves. Let but Parents throughly ſtudy their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Priviledges as Confederates with themſelves, and faithfully apply themſelves to the diſcharge of their duty towards them, and it will give good ground of hope that both he that hath ſown, and they that reap, <hi>viz.</hi> both Parents and Children, ſhall have a time, or rather an Eternity to rejoyce together.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> An Introduction to the whole enſuing Diſcourſe. The four grand Enquiries propoſed. The Reaſons of God's ordaining the Application of the token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People, reduced to three heads: The firſt <hi>(viz.)</hi> thoſe respecting God, entred upon, three Reaſons respecting God aſſigned. Firſt, his own Goodneſs, Grace, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign pleaſure. <hi>2.</hi> The Reference that the Application of the token of the Covenant hath to his Glory, the Ways how it refers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, opened. <hi>3.</hi> The reference it hath to the ſupportation and enlargement of the Kingdome of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
               <p>THat all Ordinances and Inſtitutions that are indeed of Divine Original, have a direct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the glory of God, and are ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſive of his good will unto Men, is above all controverſie among thoſe that bear the name
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106622:9"/>of Chriſtians: yet wherein their reference, at leaſt of ſome of them to that end, and of what uſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they are unto Men, and conſequently what good will is expreſſed by them, is not diſcerned by many who have the truth of Grace. Hence it comes to paſs ſometimes, that ſome Ordinances whoſe claim to that Original is moſt juſt, yet are neglected by ſome, and utterly rejected by others, and that with the greateſt fierceneſs of oppoſition, as judged of a quite contrary reference and ſignification. This (eſpecially of later years) hath been the lot of that great Ordinance of Infant-Baptiſm; the main reaſon whereof ſeems to be the ſad Corruption, or rather utter loſs of the true Doctrine of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, eſpecially of the Signs and Seals thereof, under that Antichriſtian darkneſs, that ſo long prevailed over the face of the Chriſtian World. Neither is it to be thought ſtrange, that a practice which is not apprehended to have any reference unto the glory of God, or the good and benefit of men, ſhould be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected as to its Original, and anſwerably rejected by Conſcientious Chriſtians. Hence the revival of the true Doctrine of the Covenant, and initiatory Seal, and Token hereof, at leaſt ſo far as the ſeed of Believers are concerned in the one or the other, muſt needs have a great conducency to the eſtabliſhing of the practice it ſelf, as well as to the due improvement of it both by Parents and Children.</p>
               <p>Some ſmall eſſays of that nature are at preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; only the Doctrine of the Covenant ſhall be no further lanched out into than the reſolution of four Inquiries relating to the Application of the Seal and Token thereof to Infants (the diſcuſſion of which hath been ſometimes ſince promiſed) makes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106622:9"/>neceſſary. The roſolution of thoſe Inquiries is the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the enſuing Diſcourſe, whereby I am nor without ſome hope, that at leaſt, ſome little light may ſhine forth for the diſcovery of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference this Ordinance hath to the glory of God, and how great a ſignification it carries, and ſignal expreſſion it is of his good will to men. And as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to a more clear procedure in what is intended, it muſt be remembred, that three things are at preſent preſuppoſed, and taken for granted as being elſewhere proved.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the Infant-ſeed of Believers are Joynt-Confederats with their Parents in the Covenant of Grace, or have a true and proper intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace.</item>
                  <item>2. That as Circumciſion of old was, ſo Baptiſm now is the outward Sign or Token of that Covenant.</item>
                  <item>3. That Infants as being within the Covenant, and under the promiſe of it, ought to have the outward Sign or Token applyed unto them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The things being already proved, I ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly come to the diſcuſſion of the aforeſaid enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What are the reaſons of Gods appointing the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People.</item>
                  <item>2. What are the Benefits and Advantages ariſing and accruing to them thereby.</item>
                  <item>3. What is the duty of Parents towards their Children as bearing the Token of the Covenant.</item>
                  <item>4. What is the Improvement that Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may and ought to make of the Token of the Covenant applyed to them in their Infancy, as they grow up to years of Maturity. To bigin with</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106622:10"/>1. The firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Why God hath appointed, or what are the reaſons of his appointing the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That all the Laws and Ordinances of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, yea even thoſe, of which no other reaſon can be aſſigned by us but the ſole will of the Legiſlator, are moſt rational, as agreeing with the higheſt and moſt perfect Principles of true Reaſon, is abundantly ſecured by their alone Relation to him as his, who is the only wiſe God. Nothing irrational can be the effect of Infinit Wiſdom. Hence, are we aſſured that any practice is of Divine Inſtitution, we ought, and ſo far as our hearts by renewing Grace are brought to their due obedience and allegiance unto God, we ſhall readily comply with them, as acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing in their rationality as commanded by him, who is <hi>wiſe in Heart, as well as mighty in Power</hi> or Authority. And hence it muſt needs be our Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as our Duty to bend our inquiries more after the will of God, conſtitution what ſhall be our Duty, than the reaſons of his conſtituting this or that to be ſo. Are we aſſured of his will, his Wiſdom ſecures his willing nothing but what is moſt rational, or what there is ſufficient reaſon he ſhould command; and his will alone is a ſufficient warrant for our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But yet God having made Man a rational and intelligent Creature, and given him eyes to ſee with-all, he deals not with him according to mere Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, but indulgeth him a liberty, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns it as a duty to enquire after, and ſatisfy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about the rationality of his commands: only a twofold Proviſo being attended unto.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106622:10"/>1. That he keep himſelf within the bounds of Sobriety,<note place="margin">Non ſapit qui plus juſto ſapit.</note> and preſume not to be wiſe above what is written.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That in caſe the rationality of this or that command appear not, either as not revealed by God, or as above the reach of his ſhallow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to diſcern it, he yield to mere Soveraignty, and anſwerably reſolve to obey, though he ſee no other reaſon, but only this that God hath commanded it. And for Chriſtians ſtill attending to theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoes, to ſearch after, and acquaint themſelves with the reaſonableneſs of Divine Commands, or the reaſons of God's commanding this or that as a duty, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not a little, as to their cheerful and complacential walking in ways of Obedience; ſo to their pleaſing and honouring God in any by that their obedience: For though it is true, Reaſon as darkned and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fallen man riſeth up with a ſtrong oppoſition againſt what ever is of God, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> or reaſon <hi>of the fleſh,</hi> that is carnal or corrupted wiſdom or reaſon being <hi>enmity againſt God:</hi> yet reaſon ſanctified and regulated by Supernatural light is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable unto men in matters of Religion, and greatly ſubſerves their yielding unto God due honour and glory in and by Univerſal Obedience to all his Commands. The more of ſanctified reaſon any man hath, the more clearly (ſuppoſing his due uſe and improvement of it) will he diſcern the rationality of Divine Commands, and confequently the more fully and freely will he own and aſcribe unto God the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his wiſdom appearing in the commands, and chearfully ſubmit to his Soveraignty as commanding, and anſwerably honour him by a complacential obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106622:11"/>dience. Hence Chriſtians of the higheſt reaſon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them proportionably renewed and ſanctified, will be moſt to the honour of God, and walk with the greateſt delight and ſatisfaction to themſelves in his wayes. To bring what hath been ſaid to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance before us, though the alone Revelations that God hath made in his Word of his Will, that the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant ſhould be applyed to the Inſant-ſeed of his People, (did no reaſons of that his Will appear) would be ſufficient warrant for our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ought to oblige all men to a complyance therewith; yet to make ſome inquiry into the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality of that practice, or the reaſons of Gods injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, will be greatly uſeful as to the eſtabliſhing the practice it ſelf, ſo to Believers chearſul walking therein, and honouring God thereby. The reaſons then may be conſidered, either with reſpect unto God inſtituting, or the Parents, to whoſe Seed the Token is to be applyed, or the Seed to whom the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the reaſons reſpecting God, and thus a threefold reaſon may be aſſigned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His own Goodneſs, free Grace, and ſoveraign good pleaſure. One ſpecial reaſon of all divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, yea of all that God hath done, or doth, whether as Ligiſlator or Benefactor, with reference to the benefit of faln man, muſt be reſolved into his Goodneſs, free Grace, and ſoveraign Will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Thou art good</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaking unto God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.68.) <hi>and doeſt good.</hi> God doth good, becauſe he is good, <hi>He worketh all things according to Councel of his own Will,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. As the mere goodneſs of God is the Fountain and original Spring of all the good he communicates to,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106622:11"/>or any way expreſſeth towards the children of men; ſo he worketh in the various communications and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions thereof after the alone Counſel of his own Will. Hence as the vouchſafement of the Covenant with a Sign and Token, ſo the commands requiring the Application of this Token to Infants, as well as to the adult, muſt be aſcribed both to his Grace and Goodneſs, and alſo to the pleaſure of his Will. The Protomartyr <hi>Stephen</hi> enumerates the giving unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Covenant of Circumciſion among the various expreſſions of the goodneſs and kindneſs of God to him,<note place="margin">Foedus Graetia quod obſignavit ei Circumſione. Piſcator in loco.</note> and his ſeed; for it was given to him not only for himſelf, but for his ſeed alſo: <hi>Acts</hi> 7.8. <hi>He gave unto</hi> Abraham <hi>the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion,</hi> the Covenant ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Circumciſion. For God to give to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed the Covenant, was a glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his goodneſs to him and them; but to add an outward Sign for the confirmation of it was an aggravation of that his goodneſs. The confirmation of the Covenant by an outward Sign adds to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the Covenant it ſelf, and is a higher expreſſion of the goodneſs of God both to his people and their ſeed. Hence for Patents to accept of and apply the Covenant with the Sign and Token thereof onely for and to themſelves, but to refuſe to do the like for or to their Seed, is to reject no ſmall part of that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he deſigned for them, and had by the true tenor of the Covenant granted to them; which ſuppoſing it may not be interpreted ſuch a deſpiſing of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the Apoſtle upbraids the Centiles with, and by which, as he tells them in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>They trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up to themſelves wrath, againſt the day of wrath,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106622:12"/>and revelation of the righteous judgment of God:</hi> yet it comes fo nigh to, and participates ſo much of it, as ſhould make all tender Conſcientious Chriſtians greatly cautious of it. We ſee how much God was provokt by <hi>Ahaz</hi> in refuſing a Sign when offered for the confirmation of a particular promiſe. How much more provoking may it be, when Parents not only refuſe the Sign of his Covenant, but his Covenant alſo though not for themſelves yet for their? 'Tis above queſtion to me, that it is leſs dangerous to err on the right hadd, and would be vaſtly leſs diſpleaſing unto God, for Parents to claim the Covenant for their Children, and apply the Token of it to them, upon a ſuppoſal of their intereſt therein, ſuppoſing the one not to extend, nor the other to appertain to them; than to reject and refuſe the one and the other, ſuppoſing the one doth extend, and the other apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to them. <hi>Favores ſunt ampliandi,</hi> Favours are to be inlarged. 'Tis certainly more dangerous to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſtraiten the ſavours of God to men, than to overamplify them in caſes that are dark and doubtful, though here I conceive the caſe is not ſo, but I ſpeak upon ſuppoſition that it were indeed ſo. The undervaluing or refuſing any expreſſion of the Grace and goodneſs of God unto men is greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to him. <hi>Eſau</hi> to this day bears the brand <hi>of a profane perſon</hi> for parting at ſo low a rate wich his birth right, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. 'Tis dangerous either to have our eye evil becauſe God is good to others, or to undervalue or reject any expreſſion of his goodneſs to our ſelves, or ours, but that's by the way. Now I ſay it is from the goodneſs and free Grace of God, guided in the various expreſſions thereof by the alone Councel of his own will, that he hath extended his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106622:12"/>Covenant with an ourward Sign and Token annexed, either to Believers, or their Seed, ſo one ſpecial reaſon of the one and the other muſt be aſſigned thereunto.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, The next reaſon reſpecting God <hi>is the</hi> reference and ſubſerviency that the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of Believers hath to his own glory, he is greatly glorified thereby, and that ſeveral wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Goodneſs, Grace and Love in extending his Covenant unto them is made more manifeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous unto men. As in the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, the death of Chriſt is openly ſhewn forth (<hi>as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ye openly declare, preach or ſhew forth the Lords death,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.) and conſequently both the Grace and Love of the Father in ſending his only begotten Son, and the Grace and Love of the Son in giving himſelf to be a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the ſins of men is publickly manifeſted, and made after a ſort viſible unto men. So by the Application of the Token of the Covenant, whether to the adult, or to Infants, the Covenant between God and them is publickly ſolemnized, and thereby his Goodneſs, Grace, and Love, in entring it with them reſpectively is openly declared, and made more conſpicuous unto men. And conſequently as God's extending his Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People is a further and higher expreſſion of his Goodneſs and Love, than his entring it only with themſelves; ſo by the Application of the Token to them there is a further manifeſtation of that his Goodneſs Grace and Love made unto them: and by how much the more clearly and openly any of the Attributes of God are manifeſted unto men, by ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106622:13"/>much the more meet objects they become for their acknowledgments, admiration, and adoration; and conſequently ſuch a manifeſtation of his Attributes hath a direct reference to his glory, and it is the duty of all men to yield him the glory of his Attributes by ſutable acknowledgments, admiration, and adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to the manifeſtations he makes of them. <hi>Oh! Sing unto the Lord a new ſong, for he hath done marvellous thing: his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the Victory. The Lord hath made known his Salvation: his Righteouſneſs hath he openly ſhewn in the ſight of the Heathen,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 98. 1, 2. The full explication of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not deſigned. That which alone concerns our preſent purpoſe is, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s exciting men <hi>to ſing a new ſong unto the Lord,</hi> upon this ground, or for this reaſon, <hi>that he hath made known his Salvation, and openly ſhewed his Righteouſneſs in the ſight</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes <hi>of the Heathen;</hi> by making known his Salvation he hath openly ſhewn his Righteouſneſs. The more viſible God makes any of his Attributes unto men, be the way or means by which he doth it what they will, he more is he to be praiſed, admired, and adored by them: So <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3, 4. when God hath executed judgments upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> the bleſſed Aſſembly of Victors over the Beaſt are brought in as ſinging the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſong of the Lamb, part of which is, <hi>Who ſhall not fear thee O Lord and glorifie thy Name?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, ſurely every one would do it; or oh how great is the ſtupidity of men that they do not do it? And what is the matter?<note place="margin">Accuſant Mundi ſtuporem, quod conſideratione mirabilium Dei operum ad eum timendum &amp; glorificandum non permoventur.</note> why ſhould men
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106622:13"/>fear God and glorify his Name now rather, or more than formerly? They give the reaſon. <hi>Thy Judgments,</hi> and conſequently thy Juſtice, Holineſs, and Power in the execution of them <hi>are manifeſt.</hi> The more viſible God makes his Attributes, the more he is to be glorified by men, and the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable is their ſtupidity in caſe of failure therein. Now I ſay by the Solemnization of the Covenant, as extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and entred with the Seed of Believers, by the Application of the Token thereof unto them, the Goodneſs, Grace, and Love of God is made more manifeſt, or is openly ſhewn in the ſight, or before the eyes of men, and conſequently hath a peculliar ſubſerviency to his glory. And let it be farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that as God's extending his Covenant to, and entring it with the Infant-ſeed of his People is an expreſſion of greater Goodneſs, Grace, and Love, than the entring it with the Parents alone would have been; ſo there is ſomewhat in that his extending his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Infants for the Illuſtration and Manifeſtation of the riches, and freeneſs eſ his Goodneſs, Grace, and Love, beyond what there is in his entring it with Parents, or any adult perſons whatſoever. But of that more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hereby the Soveraign Headſhip of our Lord Chriſt is publickly owned, and practically acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Parents, who in obedience to his revealed Will have the Token of the Covenant applyed to their Seed, and that two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the ſolemn and viſible dedication of theirs unto him, and entring them as Subjects of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Apoſtle tells us <hi>that for this end Chriſt both died, and roſe and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living,</hi> Rom. 4.9. As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106622:14"/>hath given him an Univerſal Headſhip over all Creatures; ſo he hath acquired the actual exerciſe thereof by his Death and Reſurrection. Now as the adult by receiving the Token of the Covenant, and dedicating themſelves thereby unto Chriſt as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Servants do publickly own, and practically acknowledg his Headſhip over themſelves; ſo by having the Token of the Covenant applyed unto theirs, and dedicating them unto Chriſt thereby, and entring them as joynt Subjects of his Kingdom, they alike own and acknowledg his Headſhip over theirs, and conſequently openly own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Univerſal Headſhip of Chriſt. They have only an abſolute power over, and right to dedicate themſelves and theirs, who, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, their, or of them,</hi> unto Chriſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in him. And hence they go to the utmoſt bounds of that power and right that God in Nature, or his Word hath inveſted them with, in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to promote, and propogate the Headſhip of Chriſt over all. Now thus publickly to own, and practically to acknowledg the Soveraign and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Headſhip of Chriſt greatly redounds not only to the glory of Chriſt as Mediator, but to the glory of God the Father. <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every name, that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus is the Lord to the glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2.9, 11. And let me ſay, hath our Lord Chriſt deſerved ſo ill at their hands, whom he hath redeemed with no leſs price than his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, that they ſhould grudg him his Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Headſhip, or ſhould refuſe to dedicate them up to him, and enter them as Subjects of his Kingdom,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106622:14"/>whom God and Nature hath inveſted with a power and right ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By a ſolemn dedicating of their Infants unto Chriſt, and entring them as Subjects of his Kingdom, by a Right or Ceremony of his own Inſtitution, they do viſibly own, and practically acknowledg his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over his own Houſe or Kingdom, as Lord and Law-giver thereof, which again greatly redounds as to his, ſo to his Father's glory. The Apoſtle infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his exhortation to Liberality to the Poor by this argument, <hi>that they,</hi> viz. the poor <hi>would glorifie God for their profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13. A practical profeſſion of our ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt, or to the Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of his Kingdom, redounds more to his and his Father's glory then a mere verbal profeſſion doth. A verbal profeſſion may be without the belief of the heart, but practice evidenceth a real belief of what is profeſſed in words. And as by realizing our belief of his Soveraignty and Headſhip over his Church, we do our ſelves more immediatly honour and glorifie Chriſt; ſo others will be provokt and ſtirred up to glorifie God for that our profeſſed ſubjection to his Goſpel. And here let it be obſerved, that as in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to ſubmit to any Command and Ordinance of Chriſt is ſo far an owning and acknowledging of his Headſhip and Soveraignty: ſo by how much the mote purely ſuch a Command or Ordinance proceeds from his ſoveraign will and pleaſure, by ſo much the more full and apparent is our owning and acknowledging of his abſolute Soveraignty. Hence in as much as poſitive commands (and ſuch is that concerning the Application of the Token of the Covenant) do more eſpecially proceed from the ſoveraign will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106622:15"/>of Chriſt, we by our profeſſed ſubjection unto them do eminently own and acknowledg that his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſoveraignty.</p>
               <p>On which account it ſeems to be (a thing not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy our obſervation,) that all more eſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations, or trials of men have been made by ſome poſitive command. And yet further, ſome Laws and Ordinances of this kind (at leaſt <hi>quoad nos,</hi>) proceed more purely and abſolutely from the mere ſoveraign will and pleaſure of Chriſt then others do. Some have the reaſon, yea <hi>(conſideratis conſiderandis)</hi> neceſſity of their Inſtitution ingraven in legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters upon them, and men by a little uſe and exerciſe of their own reaſon may be convined of the neceſſity of ſubmitting to them, in order to their enjoying the good conveyed by them; and anſwerably may ſubmit rather out of ſelf-love, then from a ſence of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Chriſt; whence their ſubmitting to them is not ſo evident an acknowledgment of his Soveraignty. But now others, however alike rational, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in themſelves, yet their rationality and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies more remote from ordinary obſervation, yea may poſſibly ſeem (at leaſt to many) to be if not irrational, yet uſeleſs and unneceſſary. Yea it muſt be further obſerved in reſpect of moſt, if not all Laws of this kind, (<hi>viz.</hi> Poſitive Laws,) though ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory reaſon of their inſtitution may be aſſigned, yet ſomewhat of ſoveraign will and pleaſure muſt be owned as the original ground of their inſtitution. And this is neceſſary, that as men beholding their rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onality, and ſeeing how they are adapted and ſuited to that end whereunto they are ordained, ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wiſdom that appears in them; ſo being <hi>non-pluſt</hi> in their enquiries after the full reaſon of them
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106622:15"/>ſhould yield unto Chriſt the honour of his ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a ready ſubmiſſion to that, the full reaſon of the inſtitution of which muſt be reſolved into his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign will and pleaſure, who is the ſupreme <hi>Ruler in Jacob.</hi> An inſtance hereof we have in this Command, requiring the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, eſpecially as theſe particular rights, Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of old and Baptiſm now was and is the Token, and Infants were, and are the Subjects to whom the one was, and the other is to be applyed; for though a ſatisfactory account of theſe particular rights being appointed, and of the Application of the one and the other to Infants as Confederates with their Parents may be given, yet the command muſt be granted to carry no obſcure impreſſions of abſolute ſoveraignty; After our utmoſt enquiries after the reaſons either of ſuch rights being inſtituted, or of their Application to Infants, we muſt leave ſomew hat to abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty. And anſwerably Parents by dedicating their Infant-ſeed unto Chriſt, and entring them as Subjects of his Kingdom, by ſuch a particular Right or Ceremonie, as they openly own, and practically acknowledg his Headſip over his own Houſe in common with their ſubjection to any other of his Commands; ſo in a ſpecial manner they own and acknowledg the abſolutneſs, of that his Soveraign Headſhip, that his alone will and pleaſure inſtamps ſuch Authority on his Commands, as that on the ſole account thereof all men ought to ſubmit, and yield cheerful obedience unto them. By our chearful and ready obedience to ſuch commands, as we eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence our own ſincerity, ſo we both glorifie Chriſt as Mediator, and God the Father who hath put all power into his hand.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:106622:16"/>3. Hereby Parents give a publick commendatory Teſtimony to the Covenant of Grace, they openly teſtifie their approbation and liking of it, they practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally proſeſs their high value of it, they declare their willingneſs that their Children ſhould come under the bond of it, and that they ſhould enjoy the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed upon the terms required in it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is a great good, and advantage unto men to enjoy that good upon thoſe terms. Now that is a great commendation to the Covenant, and doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the glory of God eſtabliſhing of it. As in caſe a man hath had a leaſe of a Manor or Farm du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, and when he grows old, and comes to die, he is willing and deſirous his ſon ſhould have the leaſe renewed to him, and that upon the ſame terms and conditions himſelf had poſſeſſed it, he thereby gives a commendatory Teſtimony to his leaſe. So when a Believer ſhall put his Children under the bond of the Covenant, and do what in him lies to intereſt them in the good contained in it, and that upon the terms and conditions himſelf hath enjoyed that good, he thereby commends the Covenant, and openly declares its worthineſs of all acceptation. It was no little commendation to the ſervice of God, for <hi>Joſhua</hi> to make that publick profeſſion, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever choice the people ſhould make as to the God they would ſerve, yet not himſelf only would, but <hi>his houſe ſhould ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24, 15. <hi>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> He would not only continue in his ſervice himſelf, but he would do what in him lay to oblige his Children to the ſervice of the ſame God. Now this did greatly commend the ſervice of God to the people, hence we ſee what an influence it had upon them, how reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106622:16"/>thev expreſs themſelves: <hi>Then the people anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſaid, God forbid that we ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerve other gods.</hi> When people are nto only reſolvedly ſteadfaſt to the ſervice of God themſelves, but are willing and deſirous that their Children ſhould, and anſwerably uſe their utmoſt endeavours chat they may ingage with them in the ſame Service, 'tis a high commendation to the Service of God. So when Parents ſhall enter their Children into, and bring them under the bond of that Covenant, which themſelves have already taken hold of, it is a very great commendation to the Covenant; they thereby publickly ſhew their approbation and value of it. Before I paſs this, let me only ſay to thoſe who do ſo zealouſly oppoſe their Childrens intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and reject the Token, by the Aplication of which God hath ordained they ſhould be brought under the bond of it, as the Lord ſaid to his People of old, when they apoſtatized from him, <hi>what ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?</hi> Jer. 2.5. So let me ſay, what iniquity have you ſound in God, that you ſhould be ſo averſe to your Childrens being brought nigh unto him? What iniquity have you found in his Covenant, that you are ſo willing that the Entail of it to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould be cut off? Surely it may well diſcourage Sinners from taking hold of the Covenant, when you, that profeſs your ſelves to underſtand it, ſhall put ſo low a value upon it, and ſhall account Intereſt in it ſuch an indifferent thing; yea ſhould ſeem to be ſo averſe to yours having an intereſt in it. Is the Good promiſed ſo ſmall? or are the Terms required ſo hard and difficult, as that the Good is no: worth having upon thoſe Terms? Alas! that Profeſſors ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106622:17"/>the Covenant no better. I doubt not but many Parents, that now in their darkneſs reject, yea diſpute againſt their Childrens intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and deride their Baptiſm would go through Fire and Water, as we ſay, that they might enjoy the one and the other, did they but fully underſtand of what benefit and advantage they would be unto them: But now through their miſguided zeal they greatly reflect upon the Covenant, and conſequently upon God the Author of it: whereas Parents by bringing their Children under the bond of it, by the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Token to them do give a publick commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it, and thereby honour and glorify God as extending it to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hereby Parents do publickly own, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally acknowledg their belief of ſuch things, which for men profeſſedly to believe, own, and acknowledg doth greatly redound to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only inſtance in ſuch things as more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are owned and acknowledged by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to Infants, Thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They publickly own and practically profeſs their belief of the Doctrine of Original fin, that there is indeed ſuch a thing as Original ſin communicated from <hi>Adam</hi> to all his poſterity, and that by means thereof all men by Nature are Children of Wrath. As Circumciſion of old, ſo Baptiſm now hath a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al reference to Original fin, eſpecially as Infants were and are the Subjects of the one and of the other. And the very Application of the one and the other to them doth preſuppoſe them under the guilt of it; and conſequently Parents by having the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant applyed to their Infants do publickly own, and practically profeſs their belief, that though they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106622:17"/>have not, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. <hi>ſinned</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>after</hi> or according <hi>to the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s tranſgreſſion,</hi> that is actually in the external violation of any precept of the Law, yet are ſubject to the curſe of the Law and Wrath of God: Now for men publickly to own, and viſibly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their belief of this Doctrine greatly redounds to the glory of God. Their guiltineſs of that ſin juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies him in all penal evils he lays upon them. What ſad complaints have ſome Heathens made concerning Man's birth, and the variety of Miſeries attending him, above what attend other Creatures, and thereby greatly reflected upon God his Creaior, as though he had not been ſo good to Man, as to other Creatures, and this from their ignorance of the Doctrine of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin? They evidently perceived the ſad fruits and effects of Original ſin, but knew not Original ſin as the cauſe of thoſe effect. But now by owning and profeſſing our belief of this Doctrine we do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly juſtifie God in all the miſeries he hath ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men unto, which muſt needs greatly redound to his honour and glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They do hereby publickly own, and practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs their belief of the Doctrine of free Grace. It's ſufficiently evident that Infants in their pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſtate are incapable of Merit, what God doth for them, he muſt needs do freely. Saith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the difference that God put between <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Eſan</hi> in reſpect of Election and Preterition, and his conſequent dealings with then reſpectively, <hi>the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpoſe of God according to electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it was ſaid unto her,</hi> viz. Rebekah, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106622:18"/>the younger,</hi> Rom. 9.11, 12. That which I only deſign from theſe words is, to ſhew that what God doth for Infants, either in regard of Election before time, or actual Donation in time, he doth it not for or according to the Merit or deſert of works, but freely of his own good pleaſure, either merely of his Grace and goode pleaſure as in reſpect of Election, or of his mere Grace and good pleaſure through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſal of the mediation of Chriſt as in reſpect of actual Donation. If he ſhould do what he doth for them of works, that is for, or according to the Merit or deſert of works, it muſt be either the works of the Infants themſelves, or the works of their Parents; not the works of Infants themſelves, for they have neither done any good or evil; not the works of their Parents,<note place="margin">Vigilantiſſime ait ex uno concubitu, gemini enim con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptierant, ne vel paternis meritis tribueretur. Si quiſquam forte di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret, ideo talis natus eſt filius, qui à pater it à erat affectus illo tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re cum ſevit in ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro matris, aut e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat ita mater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecta cum concepit, ſimul enim ambo ſunt uno tempore concepti. <hi>Auſtin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerente <hi>Beda</hi> ex Epiſtolâ ad Simpl.</note> that appears from the difference he puts in his love and hatred, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks between Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, conceived, and born, not only from the ſame Parents, but at one and the ſame time, as in the caſe of Twins. If he deal with Children according to the deſerts of Parents, he would deal alike with all Children that are ſo begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, conceived, and born: So that what God doth for Infants cannot be of works, neither of Parents, nor Children, but muſt be wholly free, of his mere Grace and goodneſs through the Mediation of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereby they publickly own, and practically profeſs their faith in, and belief of the Truth, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106622:18"/>and Power of God, his Truth and Faithfulneſs in his Word whether of threatning or promiſe, his Power as to accompliſh his Word, ſo to bleſs and make effectual his own Inſtitutions for that end whereunto they are appointed. Chriſt is the only refuge for faln man to betake himſelf to for ſecurity from the wrath to come, and the way, whereby man betakes himſelf to this refuge, is by taking hold of the Covenant, and thereby getting under the promiſes of it made in Chriſt. Hence as by Baptiſm perſons are viſibly admitted into the Covenant, and that their admiſſion is ſolemnized by coming unto Baptiſm, they are ſaid <hi>to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> Mat. 3.7. Saith <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to the Phariſees and Sadducees coming to his Baptiſm, <hi>who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> Baptiſm is a viſible incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Perſons into Chriſt, and ſolemnization of their Covenant-elation with God in him, by means whereof they viſibly come under the ſhadow of his wings, and under the promiſes made in him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are ſecured from the wrath to come: And Parents by taking hold of the Covenant for their Children, and ſolemnly dedicating them unto God in Chriſt, by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them, bring them under the ſame refuge with themſelves, they carry them along with them into this refuge from the wrath to come. New as this proceeds from, ſo it is a viſible and practical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith, (I mean in reſpect of ſuch who do indeed act from true principles, as all believers are ſuppoſed to do,) that they do believe ſhe threatnings denouncing wrath againſt man as ſain and guilty of fin; ſo that the Promiſes made in Chriſt are true and faithful, as alſo that God is able to bleſs and make
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106622:19"/>effectual his own Inſtitutions to thoſe ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they are appointed to in ſubſerviency to mans freedom from that wrath. If Parents did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Children were under the guilt of fin, and the threatnings declaring and denouncing Wrath againſt them, as under that guilt, why ſhould they put them under the Wings of Chriſt by a ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieation of them to him for the ſecuring them from Wrath? And of they did not believe Chriſt to be a ſure Refuge, and that the Promiſes in him are true and faithful, to what purpoſe ſhould they put them under his Wings, or carry them under the Covert of the Promiſes? And if they did not believe that the Application of the Token of the Covenant was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in ſome kind of ſubſerviency to their freedom from Wrath, at leaſt as growing up unto years of Maturity, and that God is able to bleſs and make effectual that Inſtitution for the uſe and end he hath appointed it, why ſhould they mind it, or take any care about it? Who will flee himſelf, or carry his Children to a Refuge, unleſs he apprehend ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? who will make that a Refuge to himſelf or his, that he apprehends not ſafety in? who will take any courſe for the ſecuring himſelf or his under any refuge, that he doth not apprehend will be effectual for that end? Hence I ſay Parents by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to their Seed do viſibly and practically profeſſ, their Faith in, and Belief of the Truth, Faithfulneſs and Power of God. It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11.28. <hi>Through Faith he kept the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, ad the ſprinkling of Blood, leſt he that deſtroyed the firſt-born ſhould touch them;</hi> believing the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounced againſt <hi>Egypt</hi> concerning the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their firſt-born, and believing the promiſes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106622:19"/>made to themſelves concerning their own freedom from that Plague, upon their ſprinkling the blood of the Paſchal Lamb upon the poſts of their doors, he keeps the Paſsover, and ſprinkleth, or takes care that the blood of the Paſchal Lamb be ſprinkled upon their door poſts accordingly. And as he did this through Faith, ſo his doing it was a viſible and practical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Faith, <hi>Pari fide &amp; nobis circa Sacramenta eſt opus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pareus.</hi> As there is a need of the like Faith, ſo the like Faith is viſibly and practically pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Seed of Believers, and this greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the glory of God. This is mentioned as a peculiar diſcovery of the excellency of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Faith, implying that much, or as our Lord Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>a great Faith</hi> is required unto, and diſcovered by his obſervation of that Inſtitution. And let me ſay, did Parents act in the Application of the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to their Infant-ſeed from ſo pure a Principle of Faith as they ought to do, and did they act their Faith as they ought with reference to the Token as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to them, their Faith would be found to have a very excellency in it, they might be well renowned for the excellency of their Faith. Now at the greater rate of excellency Faith acts, the more is God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and glorified thereby, ſee <hi>Rom</hi> 4.19, and 20. From what hath been ſaid we may evidently ſee what a direct, yea how great a reference the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers hath to the glory of God, and from that refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it hath to his glory it is in part that he requires it.</p>

The ſupportation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Kingdom of our Lord Chriſt here in the World is greatly ſubſerved hereby.

                  <hi>CHAP. II</hi> The Reaſons of God's ordaining the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People reſpecting the Parent from three Reaſons now aſſigned. <hi>1.</hi> The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ariſing therefrom to their Faith. Howgreatly their Faith is advantaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewed. <hi>2.</hi> It is for the advantage of their Joy and Comfort in their Children. <hi>3.</hi> It is that God may thereby lay greater Obligations upon them to endeavour the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of their Children and their Perſonal Embracement of the Covenant as growing up to years of Maturity. Thy variety of Obligations lying upon Paedo-Baptiſts ſo to do above what Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend themſelves to ly under opened . How much greater ground of hope for ſucceſs in their endeavours Paedo-Baptiſts have, than Anti-Pedo-Baptiſts according to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple can have, ſhewed. The third Head of Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as reſpect the Seed of Believers mentioned.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Head of Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as reſpect the Parents, to whoſe Seed the Token is to be applyed, and thus theſe four Reaſons lie obvious</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106622:21"/>1. Firſt it is for the advantge of their Faith to be acted with reference to their Seed; by the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Token of the Covenant to their Seed, they have a viſible Ratification and Confirmation of the Covenant and Promiſes thereof, as extended and made to them. And that we may more fully diſcover what advantage the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Seed of Believers is to their Faith to be acted with reference to them, we many obſerve that the Promiſes of the Covernant reſpecting the Seed of Believers are conſiderable two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Promiſes reſpecting the Seed of Believers are made to Parents with reference to, and on the behalf of their Seed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are made to the Seed themſelves as deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from ſuch Parents.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Promiſes reſpecting the Seed of Believers are firſtly and primarily made to their Parents, and are particular branches of the Covenant eſtableſhed with them. The Covenant confiſts in more Promiſes than one, or is comprehenfive of ſeveral diſtinct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſome of which only concern Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or contain ſome good to be enjoye only by themſelves in their own perſons; other reſpect theirs, though the Promiſes are firſtly made to them, yet the good contained in them redounds to and is injoyed by theirs. Thus when God promiſeth to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed aſter him, the promiſe is firſt made to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, though the good contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in redound to, and is injoyed by his Seed. And the ſame is true of the Promiſes as continued to Believers, they are firſtly made to Parents. Saith God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abraham, I know him, that the will command his children and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106622:21"/>the way of the Lord to do Judgment and Juſtice, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him,</hi> that is, that which he hath promiſed to him, <hi>Gen,</hi> 18.19. Now what was it that God had ſpoken of or Promiſed to <hi>Abraham?</hi> why not only that he would be a God to him as perſonally conſidered, but a God to his Seed or Houſhold after him, and would give unto them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion. This twofold good of God's being a God to his Seed, and giving them the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by his Seed, yet was firſtly promiſed to him with reference to, and on their behaſf. Children ſtand at ſo little a diſtance from Parents, that they are ſaid to be the Parents themſelves multiplyed. Parents do after a ſort ſubſiſt in their Children, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably the good or evil of Children is accounted both in Scripture, and according to the di ctates of Nature, the good or evilof their Parents. <hi>Have mercy upon me,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Syrophenician,</hi> when ſhe came to Chriſt for cure for her afflicted Daughter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22. She accounts her Daughter's affliction her own, and the Daughter's cure would be the Mother's Mercy. Hence promiſes of good to, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>tnings of evil againſt Children are frequently firſtly made to, or denounced againſt the Parents themſelves as a good or evil unto them. So here the Promiſes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reſpecting the Seed are particular and diſtinct branches of the Covenant as eſtabliſhed with Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves: But</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Promiſes may be conſidered as made to the Seed, they are not made only to their Parents, but alſo to their Seed with them, and hence Parents and Childaen are to be lookt upon as Joynt-Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106622:22"/>with God. Hence ſaith the Lord to <hi>Abraham: I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee, in their Generations,</hi> Gen. 17.7. The Covenant was eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, as well with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and Seed here includes his immediate Children as well as mediate; and hence again the Promiſe is ſaid to be to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Believers as well as to Believers themſelves. <hi>The Promiſe is to you and to your Children,</hi> Acts 2.39. And Children, as they grow up to years of maturity, may and ougth to lay claim to the Promiſes as made to themſelves as well as made to thier Parents on their behalf. Now according to this twofold conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Promiſes of the Covenant, there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold uſe and end of the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Seed of Believers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thereby that part of the Covenant entred with Parents reſpecting their Seed is ratified, ſealed, and confirmed to the Parents. Hence in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. ſaith the Lord, <hi>This is my Covenant, which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee, every Man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed. You,</hi> in the former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Verſe intends both <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed as diſtinguiſhed from his and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Natural Childre. This is ſaid to be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that they ſhould keep between God and them, <hi>viz.</hi> that every Man-child among them ſhould be circumciſed. Hence it is evident that the Circumciſion of their Male children was the Covenant to be kept by them. And how was the Circumiciſion of their Children ſaid to be the Covenant between God and them, to be kept by them? why partlyas that is in part the reſtipulation of the Covenant required on their part, and partly as it is the Ratification, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106622:22"/>Confirmation of the Covenant made with them, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of the Covenant reſpecting their Seed: ſo that Circumciſion of their Male children was in part their duty, or a part of the reſtipulation to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, and alſo a confirmation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (<hi>viz.</hi> thoſe reſpecting their Seed) made unto them. And what is here ſaid of Circumciſion, is true of Baptiſm, in as much as Circumciſion, is here ſpoken of as confidered under that general notion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Token of the Covenant. And what is ſpoken of Circumciſion as confidered in that general notion is alike applicable to Baptiſm: It ſucceeds Circumicſion in that notion, and there is a very great aptneſs and fitneſs in the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Seed, to ſeal and confirm unto Believers this part of the Covenant entred with them on the behalf, or with reſpect to their Seed, when God ſhall add to his Promiſes a Token to be applyed not only to Believers themſelves, but to their Seed, that muſt needs have a very great aptneſs and fitneſs further to confirm and eſtabliſh the Promiſes to them reſpecting their Seed. And a twofold reaſon may be aſſigned of Gods ratifying and confirming to Believers this part or branch of the Covenant reſpecting their Seed by the Application of the Sign or Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Sign or Token of the Covenant, might be proportionable to the Covenant, of which it is the Sign or Token.</p>
               <p>The Covenant entred with Believers conſiſts (as I have ſaid) in two branches. The firſt reſpects themſelves; The ſecond their Seed. Now the Sign or Token as applyed only to themſelves, though it is true, it doth ratifie and confirm the whole Covenant,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106622:23"/>yet it hath a peculiar reſpect to that branch reſpecting themſelves. There is nothing in the Token as apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to themſelves ſignifying their being bleſſings to their Seed, and conſequently that branch of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant would not have been confirmed, at leaſt ſo expreſsly and clearly as was neceſſary for the help and advantage of their Faith, by the ſole Applicatin of the Token to themſelves, becauſe then the Token had not been fully proportionate to the Covenant. Hence that the Token might be proportionate to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and anſwerably more fully advantageous to the Faith of Believers, God hath ordained the Application of it to the Seed as well as to the Parents themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great addition, that by theſe Promiſes of the Covenant reſpecting their Seed is made to the good of the Covenant, ſeems to make ſuch a ſuperadditional confirmation neceſſary. So great an addition is made to the good of the Covenant as entred with Parents by the extenſion of it to their Seed, that the Promiſes might have even <hi>non-pluſt</hi> their Faith, had not this ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional confirmation been given. Wee ſee how <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſtands even amazed as not knowing what to ſay, when he not only reviews what God had already done for him, but confiders the Promiſe further made to his Houſe for ſo long a time to come, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 19. So for God not only to promiſe to be a God to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers themſelves, but to make their Children, and that as ſuch, Fellow-heirs with them of the ſame Promiſe, might have even <hi>non-pluſt</hi> their Faith, had he not expreſsly ratified and confirmed that branch by the Application of the Token to their Seed. The glory of the Covenant might have overcome a weak Faith, had it not been ſutable confirmed. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other endand uſe of the Application of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106622:23"/>Token of the Covenant to the Seed of Believers is the ratificatio and confirmatiou of the Promiſes as made unto them, and conſequently for the more full ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the good promiſed to them, and it ought to be ſo lookt upon, and improved by them as they grow up to years of Maturity, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now then to bring what hath been ſaid to our preſent purpoſe; we may ſee what advantage Believers have to their Faith, as to be acted with reserence to their Seed, or the good promiſed to them, by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them; they have not only that part of the Covenant reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Seed ratified and confirmed to themſelves, but they alſo ſee the Covenant as entred with, and the Promiſes as made to their Seed ratiried and confirmed unto them: How far Faith is to be acted by Parents with reference to their Seed will appear, when we conſider what Promiſes are made unto them, with the good contained in them, and conſequently conveyed to and ſetled upon them by thoſe Promiſes. But how far, or in what Sence ſoever Faith is to be acted, we ſee Believers have no little advantage for it. By the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to their Seed they have not only the Promiſes as made to themſelves with reſerence to their Seed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to themſelves, but thoſe Promiſes as made to their Seed confirmed unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another reaſon may be, that God hereby might provide for, and lay a ſure foundation unto the joy and comfort of his People in their Children, according to what Faith Believers can act with reference to their Children, and the advantage they have to that their Faith, ſo will their joy and comfort in them be. Children are great Bleſſings, choice Mercies, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106622:24"/>peculiar Comforts unto Men: We ſee how <hi>Jacob</hi> looks upon the gift of Children; he accounts it a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Gift, when <hi>Eſau</hi> ſeeing his Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren puts the queſtion, Who are theſe? ſaith he, <hi>They are the Children, that God hath graciouſly given me,</hi> Gen. 32.5. He accounts his children as an effect or great Grace and Mercy to him: So our Lord Chriſt tells us; <hi>a Woman when ſhe is in travel hath ſorrow, becauſe her hour is come; but when ſhe is delivered of a Child, ſhe remembers no more her anguiſh for joy that a Man is born into the World,</hi> John 16.21. The joy that a Man is born ſwallows up the remembrance of her ſorrows: Children are Parents joys and comforts. But now were it ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that Infants (I mean ſuch as are born of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parents) have no intereſt in the Covenant, nor any ſecurity thereby from thedreadful effects of their natural ſtates and conditions, the apprehenſion and conſideration of what their ſtates and conditions are, muſt needs greatly allay, if not utterly deſtroy the joy and comfort of Parents in them: For Parents to ſee the fruit of their bodies is matter of joy, but when they reflect upon their Natural conditios, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member they are Children of Wrath, this muſt needs greatly weaken, or rather utterly deſtroy that joy. And it is no little matter of admiratio, how any, that know and believe the Scriptures declaring, how the whole race of Mankind are involved in the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin as being virtually and ſeminally in him, as alſo how humane Nature is vitiated and corrupted with ſin, and ſo propagated from Parents to Children, and conſequently how all as born into the World are guilty before God, and children of Wrath: I ſay, how any, that know and believe theſe things, can have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106622:24"/>any joy, or rake any comfort in their Children, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have ſome hope, that through the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace they are freed from the guilt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at leaſt a probability of ſecurity from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of that their ſtate. As for that ſuppoſition of ſome, that only Natural death was threatned againſt <hi>Adam</hi> in caſe of ſin, and conſequently that no other kind of death is come upon all Mankind through his fall, and hereupon that that is the only kind of death that Infants are ſubject to: Or that ſuppoſition of others, that the guilt of Original ſin is wholly <hi>de facto</hi> taken away from all Manking by Chriſt, and conſequently that all are born in a ſtate of Peace with God, and under the ſame Love, and Favour that <hi>Adam</hi> was under in his ſtate of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; what relief ſoever the one or the other yields, can only ariſe from the darkneſs and errour of the underſtanding and judgment, having no true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Word of God; neither, were they grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would they contribute in the leaſt degree ſo much to they joy and comfort of Parents in their Children, as the Covenant if truly underſt od will do. And as for thoſe which fetch their relief from the Doctine of Election, though that Doctrine be certainly true, and may be improved as a conſiderable relief againſt that ſorrow and grief, that muſt rationally ariſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents from the apprehenſion of the natural ſtates and conditions of their Children; yet I doubt, if all things be well weighted, it will be found greatly wanting as to the yielding that plenary relief that it hath been uſeuſlly endeavoured to be improved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; in as much as Election neither ſecures any from death in their Infant-ſtate, nor can be looked upon according to any Scripture-ground as a ſecurity againſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106622:25"/>the dreadful effects of that ſtate and condition, in caſe of death in that ſtate: However this ſeems evident, that the relief to be fetcht from thence is alike to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers with reſpect to their Children as to Believers with reſpect to theirs. Set aſide intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and the Promiſes thereof, and a Believer hath no more aſſurance from Seripture that his Seed belongs to the Election of Grace, than any other man hath; or ſuppoſe he ſehould, yet that ſuch as die in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy do belong thereunto, he hath rather ground to fear than to hope: yea the ground he hath to fear they do not is vaſtly greater, than the ground he hath to hope that they do. And for Believers to have a clearer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and apprehenſion of the loſt eſtate of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as born Children of Wrath than others have, and yet to have no other ground of hope concerning them than others have, muſe needs greatly allay their comfort and joy in them; yea they muſt rationally have leſs joy and take leſs comfort in their Children, than others have or do take in theirs. But now the Covenant as entred with Believers, extending to, and taking in their Children with them, and that as ſealed and confirmed by an outward and viſible Sign or To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both to them and their Seed, is a precious ground of hope to them concernign their Children, and may, if not wholly, yet in a great meaſure relieve them under that ſorrow and grief that other wiſe would ariſe from the conſideration of their Ioſt ſtates by Nature. Now they may rationally rejoyce and take comfort in them, as will appear more fully hereafter. To have had a bare promiſe belonging ot their Children would have conduced greatly to their comfort and joy in them; but to have the Promiſes confirmed, and that ſuch various ways, muſt need s greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106622:25"/>their joy and comfort. And God is willing that his People ſhould have the full joy and comfort of the Mercies and Eleſſings he gives them, and in particular of their Children, they being to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the choiſeſt of thoſe Mercies and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. This made <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the one his own child, the other his grand-child, ſo gract comforts to <hi>Abraham,</hi> viz. that he could look upon them <hi>as Heirs with him of the ſame Promiſe.</hi> Could Parents only look upon their Children as children of Wrath, alas! what comfort or joy could they take in them? But now ſeeing them Heirs of the ſame Promiſes with themſelves, and theſe Promiſes alike ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them as to themſelves, now they may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally rejoyce and take comfort in them; and that may be one reaſon why God hath not only extended his Coventant, but appointed the Application of the Token thereof to them, that they many have ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God may have appointed the Applicatio of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People, that he might thereby lay a greater obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them, and more effectually provoke them to a diligent uſe of all thoſe means, and a vigorous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all thoſe duties himſelf hath directed them to, ſubſervient to their Childrens embracement of the Covenant, and giving themſelves up to him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour thereof, as they grow up to years of maturity. The multiplication of the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and thereby the ſupportation and increaſe of the Kingdom of Chriſt, the reductio of faln Man from the power of ſin and Satan unto himſelf, and thereby delivering them from the Wrath to come, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to eternal happineſs and bleſſedneſs to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106622:26"/>praiſe of his own Grace; are the great ends of God both in extending the Covenant to the Seed of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ordaining the Application of the Token thereof unto them; the attainment of all which ends is greatly ſubſerved by the Application of the Token of the Covenant, as thereby Parents become under a greater obligation to bring them up (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> This I ſhall the rather infiſt upon, becauſe the late Author, whoſe Treatiſe hath been afore examined, hath ſeen meet (upon what grounds he declares not) to charge our Practice of Infant-Baptiſm as laying a foundation to Ignorance and Profaneneſs; though himſelf a little after (as was there obſerved) ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſinuates, or rather plainly confeſſeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and unreaſonableneſs of that charge: and whether our Judgment and Practice, or our oppoſers be thore juſtly chargeable with that miſchief, ſhall now (God willing) be inquired into, only premiſing theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, That that cannot with any ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be charged upon any Practice or Doctrine, as a miſchief attending the one or the other, which is noly conſequential of ſome particular miſtakes of particular perſons owning that doctrine, or walking in ſuch a Practice. Let it be granted, as I ſhall not deny, but ſome Paedo-Baptiſts have faln into, and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch groſs miſtakes about the uſes and ends of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as have a too evident tendency to further Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Profaneneſs among thoſe that profeſs the Chriſtian Doctrine. Yet two things may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are only the miſtakes of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106622:26"/>men that can be juſtly charged to be of that tendency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That thoſe miſtakes reſpect Baptiſm in general, and not as applyed to Infants rather then to grown perſons. And what an unrighteous charge that is, when that is imputed to the practice of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which may only poſſibly enſue from the miſtakes of ſome particular men, and thoſe reſpecting the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants no more then the Baptiſm of grown perſons, is obvious to all. Such Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices as indeed lay the ſtrongeſt obligations upon men to their duty either towards God or Man, may through the miſtakes of ſome about them ſeem not only to countenance the neglect of that duty, but be taken to give an abſolute diſcharge from it, yea to incourage to the direct contrary fins and impieties. To give inſtances is ſuperfluous. But to charge ſuch Doctrines or Practices with the miſchief of laying a ſoundation to ſuch fins and impieties, againſt which they moſt ſtrongly oblige; which only through the mſtakes of men about them, have been improved by ſome to ſuch an ill purpoſe, is moſt irrational and abſurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt alſo be premiſed, that mens living in the neglect of their duty, or in ſinsand impieties lying oppoſite thereunto, is no ſafe rule according to which to judge of the tendency of their avowed Judgments and Practices. Thus to make the actions or carriages of ſome owning the Doctrine and Practice of Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Baptiſm towards their Children the rule according to which they judge of the tendency of that D ctrine and Practice, is not only unſafe but altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. 'Tis poſſible that ſome that own that Doctrine and Practice, may not underſtand how great an obligation lyes upon them thereby, to the unmoſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106622:27"/>care and diligence in the education of their Children. And it is alike poſſible that others that do underſtand that obligation, may greatly neglect that duty they know themſelves obliged to. And let me ſay, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think that there are few of our oppoſers will be very forward to have the actions and carriages of Parents towards their Children made the <hi>Tecme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> or teſt of the ſoundneſs or unſoundneſs of their or our Judgment and Practice, neither will they be willing that the controverſie ſhall be determined by that rule. It is too notorious that ſome have proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly declared their judgments to be againſt Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and the likewayes of inſtructing Children in the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and againſt an authorative requiring them ſo much as to uſe and attend upon the means appointed by God for the working of Grace in the hearts of Men, as well as againſt the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. And how evident a foundation is laid thereby to Ignorance and Profaneneſs is not difficult to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; neither dare any of our oppoſers (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) affirm that the generality of Anti-Paedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts go beyond the generality of Paedo-Baptiſts in care and diligence in iuſtructing their Children, or uſing the means ſubſerving their converſion, and taking hold of the Covenant as they grow to years of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Let us then ſet aſide the miſtakes of ſome, and wilful neglects of others on the one, and on the other ſide, and inquire whether the Doctrine and Practice maintained by us, or by them, as truly ſtated, may be more deſervedly charged with the miſchief afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. And here two things offer themſelves to our enquiry.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether Paedo-Baptiſts or Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts, according to their reſpective Judgments and Practices,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106622:27"/>ly under the greater obligations, and have the more effectual motives to provoke and ſtir them up to the diligent uſe of all means, and faithful performance of all duties ſubſerving their Childrens converſion, and perſonal embracement of the Covenant as they grow up to years of maturity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether have they greater and ſurer ground of hope, or are under a greater probability that their uſe of means and performance of duty ſhall be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to the ends mentioned. That it is the duty of all men to endeavour the converſion of their Children, and uſe of all means in order thereunto, and that the ſucceſs and efficacy of all end eavours of that nature, and uſe of means for that end, depend upon the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, is at preſent taken for granted. Our only enouiries are, whether Parents of the one or the other perſwafion, have the ſtronger obligations, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual motives to provoke and ſtir them up to the uſe of means, and performance of their duties ſubſerving the forementioned ends, and whether have the greater ground to hope for ſucceſs therein, and conſequently whether the one or the other's uſe of means and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty may be rationally concluded to be ordinarily more effectual and ſucceſsful. To begin with the</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Which how it ought to be refolved will eaſily appear by a double conſideration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whatever obligations Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts can plead, or pretend themſelves to ly under, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever motives they can according to their judgment and practice rationally improve, to provlke and ſtir up themſelves to the diligent uſe of means, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duty in order to the converſion of their Children, the ſame obligations ly upon, and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106622:28"/>ſame motives may as rationally be improved by Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Baptiſts for the provoking and ſtirring up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to alike diligent uſe of means, and performance of their duties in order to the converſion of their Children.</p>
               <p>I can at preſent call to mind only two things, that can with any ſhew of reaſon be pretended to ly as obligations upon, and be improved as Motives by Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts for the purpoſes mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what confeſſedly ly upon, or may be improved by Paedo-Baptiſts. The</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is their profeſſed owning and acknowledging their Children as ſuch to have no intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or right to the Token thereof. Now it may be ſaid, thoſe that profeſſedly diſclaim their Childrens having an intereſt in the Covenant, and right to the Seal thereof, and anſwerably apprehend them to be in the ſame condition with the reſt of Mankind, who are yet ſtrangers to the Covenants of Promiſe, muſt rationally be under a ſtronger obligation to endeavour their converſion, that ſo they may come regularly to an intereſt in both the Covenant, and token thereof, than thoſe who take their Children to be already in the Covenant, and anſwerably have applyed the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant to them. Can a man that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veives his Children to be already in Covenant with God, and hath anſwerably applyed the Token of the Covenant to them, apprehend himſelf under ſuch an obligation to inſtruct them, and uſe the means for their converſion; as a man muſt needs apprehend himſelf to be, that utterly diſclaims any preſent inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that they havei in it, and anſerably ſuſpends the Application of the Token to them? But to that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. It is true the judgment and praactice of Auti-Pedo-Baptiſts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106622:28"/>lays no ſmall obligation upon them to uſe their utmoſt endeavours after the early converſion of their Children. Thoſe that ſuppoſe their children to have no intereſt in, or benefit by the Covenant as deſcended from them, ſure are greatly concerned to uſe all means the Scriptures direct them to, whereby they may be brought into Covenant with God, through their own perſonal performance of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it themſelves. And it is well if the men of that perſwaſion would ſeriouſly conſider the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they are under, and how they acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with reference thereunto. But let it be obſerved, that to endeavour the converſion of their Children, and that they do perſonally take hold of the Covenant, equally concerns Paedo-Baptiſts, as it doth Anti-Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Baptiſts, though not with reference to one and the ſame end. Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts are to endeavour the converſion of their Children, and their perſonal imbracement of the Covenant, that they may come under the benefits and bleſſings of it. Paedo-Baptiſts are to endeavour the converſion of their Children, and their perſonal imbracement of the Covenant, that their Covenant-ſtate may be continued to them, and conſequently that they may enjoy the bleſſings and benefits of the Covenant. So that both are equally obliged to ſeek and endeavour their childrens perſonal imbracement of the Covenant, only the one in order to their coming into, the other in order to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their Covenant-ſtate. It's true, in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the late Author it is a contradiction to hold the Doctrine of Perſeverance, to baptize the Children of Believers, as including them in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and yet after teach them converſion, to keep to his phraſe. But this imagination ariſeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106622:29"/>merely from ignorance about the Covenant, as entred with the Seed of Believers. Their Covenant-ſtate ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely of it ſelf infallibly ſecures not their Regeneration, or a ſaving work of Grace upon their hearts, during their pure Infant-ſtate. The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Covenant-intereſt is wholly without them, <hi>viz.</hi> in their Parents; but as they come to years of maturity, it is devolved upon themſelves; and there is a neceſſity of a ſaving cloſe with Chriſt, and ſincere reſignation of themſelves to God in him as his, on their parts in order to the continuance of their Covenant-ſtate: which that they may do, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are to endeavour in the uſe of all means God hath directed them to. And the neceſſity hereof is an equal obligation upon Parents to uſe thoſe means in order thereunto, that the neceſſity of ſuch a cloſe with Chriſt is upon thoſe who diſclaim their preſent intereſt in the Covenant, to uſe the means in order to that their cloſing in with Chriſt, that they may be brought into Covenant with God. So that I ſay both Paedo-Baptiſts and Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts are equally obliged to ſeek and endeavour the converſion of their Children, or to bring them to a ſaving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal cloſe with Chriſt, though the one doth it that his Children may have an intereſt in the Covenant, which before he apprehended them to want: the other that their Children may be continued in Covenant, and anſwerably injoy the ſull benefits and bleſſings of it. That which ſo ſtrongly obligeth Parents to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their Childrens intereſt in the Covenant, is their injoyments of the benefits and bleſſings of it; and continuance in Covenant is of equal neceſſity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, as the firſt admiſſion into it is. Hence the obligation in the general is one and the ſame on all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106622:29"/>Parents, be their judgments for or againſt their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens intereſt in the Covenant, and right to the Sign and Token of it, to endeavour, and anſwerably uſe all means in order to their Childrens converſion, and ſaving cloſe with Chriſt; only the one doth it that his Children may have admiſſion into, the other that they may be continued in a Covenant-ſtate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other thing pleadable as a greater obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon and motive to Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and ingage them to a diligent uſe and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all duties in order to their Childrens Faith and Repentance, is their denyal of them to have as ſuch any Memberſhip in the Church, and any right to the bleſſings, priviledges, and benefits attending the neceſſity of Regeneration, Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in order to their admiſſion thereinto, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of thoſe benefits and bleſſings. Now it may be ſaid, ſure thoſe who are of this perſwaſion muſt needs be more ſtrongly obliged, and have more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al motives to provoke them to endeavour the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Children, than thoſe that conveive their Children already members of the Church, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably are already intereſted in thoſe benefits and bleſſings. To this I ſhall only ſay as before, that the obligations upon, and motives to the one and the other to endeavour the converſion of their Children are one and the ſame, though the ends are different; for to wave that queſtion, whether Infants are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the univerſal, or into a particular Church, this is certain, that the want of Faith and Repentance, when grown up to years of maturity, diſannuls all right, <hi>Coram Deo,</hi> to their Memberſhip in the Church, be it univerſal, or particular, and forefeits
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106622:30"/>their right to all the bleſſings, benefits, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that as admitted thereunto they had a right to, and intereſt in. Now it is a right to, and injoyment of thoſe bleſſings and priviledges that is the obligation and motive to Parents to endeavour the converſion of their Children. Church-memberſhip abſolutely conſidered ſiguifies nothing; 'tis intereſt in, and the injoyment of the aforeſaid benefits, bleſſings and priviledges that makes Church-memberſhip a good unto men, whether old or young. Now I ſay, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Faith and Repentance are as neceſſary to the continuing an intereſt in, and actually injoying them to thoſe who are already Members of the Church, as they are for their firſt admiſſion thereinto, and thereby coming to an intereſt in, and the injoyment of them, who afore were Aliens, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, from the Common wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or wholly out of the Church. So that the obligations upon, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ingaging Parents to endeavour the converſion of their Children, or bring them to true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as they grow up to years of maturity, are the ſame to all men, whether of the one, or the other perſwaſion. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other conſideration I would offer is, That there are ſeveral obligations lying upon, and ſeveral motives improvable by Paedo-Baptiſts, beyond what thoſe of the contrary perſwaſion can apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under, or can be rationally improved by them, to provoke them diligenly to uſe all means, and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly perform all duties, they are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures directed to in order to their Childrens conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Faith and Repentance.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, There is that ſpecial intereſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety that God hath in their Children, God lays
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106622:30"/>claim to a ſpecial propriety in the Seed of his People, they are his. Hence he aggravates the ſin of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient People, in offering up their children to Idols, by the conſideration of his own propriety in them, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, and 21.) <hi>Moreover thou haſt taken thy ſons and thy daughters whom thou haſt born unto me, and theſe baſt thou ſacrificed unto them to be devoured,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> to their Idols) <hi>is this of thy whoredoms a ſmall matter, that thou haſt ſlain my children?</hi> They were theirs by Generation, but his by Adoption. To offer any ſacrifice to Idols is exceeding bad, but to offer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſacifices is worſe; but to offer their children that proceed from their own bowels, is yet a higher aggravation of their ſin. There was not only cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that even in the higheſt degree. And yet further, that which greatly aggravated their ſin was, that thoſe they ſacrificed were not in their own power, they were, God's children that they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and anſwerably here was the higheſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, I may call it Sacriledge, a robbing God to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Idols. But this we ſee, God claims a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar intereſt and propriety in the Seed of his People, and they are not only his, as all Creatures are, but they are his by ſpecial choice of them for his own uſe and ſervice; therefore Believers, including their Seed, are ſaid to be <hi>a choſen generation</hi> (I Pet. 2.9.) and according to a ſpecial relation they ſtand in towards him, they are called <hi>his ſervants,</hi> (Levit. 25.41.) Now this intereſt and propriety that God hath in the Seed of his People is a ſtrong obligation upon them to bring them up for God, for his uſe and ſervice, that they may anſwer the relation wherein they ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. God gives his People children, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſteth them with them, but it is to bring them up
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106622:31"/>for him. Hence to neglect the holy education of Children, is not only to tranſgreſs a command, but to be unfaithful in a truſt, which aggravates the ſin.</p>
               <p>A truſt lays a peculiar obligation upon men to be faithful in it, <hi>It is required in Stewards that a man be found faithful,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2.) when a man hath intruſted his child with another to be educated and inſtructed by him in any Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he expects faithfulneſs in him: and the very conſideration of the child's being intruſted with him for ſuch an end or purpoſe would ſtrongly oblige him thereunto. Thus the Seed of Believers are God's, he claims propriety in them, and intruſts them with Parents to be brought up for himſelf; and both Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Faithfulneſs requires that they do bring them up accordingly. The Apoſtle improves it as an argument to ingage Believers to glorifie God both with ſoul and body, becauſe both <hi>are his,</hi> (1 Cor. 6.19, 20.) Now as they are to glorify God both with foul and body; ſo they are to endeavour after ſuch a fitneſs and diſpoſition of both, that they may be more apt and meet to glorifie him with both: So their Children being the Lord's, they ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after their fitneſs and meetneſs for his uſe and ſervice, and anſwerably to educate and bring them up: And that intereſt and propriety that God hath in them, with the conſideration of their being intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them for him, is a ſtrong obligation upon them ſo to do: Sure it muſt be grievous to tender hearts to think that God's own ſervants ſhould prove enemies to him, eſpecially this being through any neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect on their part, that thoſe that God hath deſigned for himſelf, ſhould rebel againſt him through a fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106622:31"/>on their part in reſpect of their duty towards them. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the Parents own act in dedicating theirs unto God, and ratifying and ſolemnizing that dedication of them by the Application of the Token of the Covenant. They are not only God's by vertue of his choice, but by vertue of their Parents reſignation and dedication of them to him; which dedication they have made of them to God, they have alſo rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and confirmed in an outward and ſolemn way by applying the Token of the Covenant to them, and that muſt needs (ſuppoſing them to underſtand what they do) more ſtrongly oblige, and more effectually move then to bring them up for God. They give them up to God to be his under their own hands and ſeals, as I may ſo ſpeak. Now Parents thus dedicating and giving up their children to God, doth neceſſarily imply and include a purpoſe to bring them up for God, otherwiſe their giving them up to him would be mere hypocriſie and deceit. And therefore when <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> had dedicated <hi>Samuel</hi> unto God, to ſerve him in the Tabernacle from his very Child-hood, they bring him up betimes to the Tabernacle, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before he was capable of perfoming any ſervice there: It was immediatly as he was weaned, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to <hi>be young,</hi> (1 Sam. 1.24.) <hi>a child a child,</hi> as the Hebrew<note n="*" place="margin">Hebraei, cum ſuperlativis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reant, pro iis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minatione utun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> is, that is, a very young child; and the reaſon of their bringing him up ſo early, is conceived to be, that he might be inſtructed in the Law, and thereby fitted and prepared for future ſervice; having given him up to God, they were careful to bring him up for God, to bring him up ſo, as he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106622:32"/>might be fitted for his ſervice. And this ſincerity and uprightneſs in the dedication that Parents made of their Children unto God doth indiſpenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. <hi>I know Abraham,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>that he will command his Children and his bouſhold after him,</hi> (Gen. 18.19.) as if the Lord ſhould ſay, I know him to be a faithful and upright man; hence having given up his Children and Houſhold to me, he will uſe the means that they may ſerve me. So when <hi>Jepthah</hi> had vowed that whoſoever came firſt out of his door to meet him ſhould be the Lords, though it proved to be his daughter, and ſhe his only Child, yet he will give her up to God, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of his vow (what that was I determine not) and he gives this reaſon, <hi>I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot go back,</hi> Judg. 11.35. His own act in dedicating his daughter, though it was but an implicite dedication of her in particular, is to him an indiſpensible obligation to give her up to God. So Parents actual dedication of their Children unto God, eſpecially having ratified and ſolemnized that dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Application of the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them, adds greatly to the obligation that they are under to bring them up ſo, as that they may be the Lord's, may give up themſelves to ſerve and honour him when they grow up to a capacity ſo to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are the great advantages that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are under, in order to the injoyment of all the grace, benefits, and bleſſings of the Covenant, as a further obligation upon, and motive to believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, diligently to uſe the means, and perform their duty ſubſervient thereunto. What theſe advantages are, ſhall (if the Lord will) be ſhewed hereafter.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106622:32"/>At preſent I ſay for Parents to ſee their Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpecial advantages in order to their injoyment of the Grace, benefits, and bleſſions of the Covenant, muſt needs ſtrongly oblige, and powerfully move as well as incourage them to endeavour that they may come to the actual injoyment of them. When a man either ſeeth himſelf, or his Children, in a fair way, and under ſpecial advantages to injoy any good, he is thereby provokt to greater diligence in the uſe of means, that either himſelf, or his child may injoy that good. This was that which at leaſt in part quickned <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſo great importunity that he might go over <hi>Jordan,</hi> to ſee the good Land, <hi>viz. Canaan,</hi> becauſe God had begun to ſhew him his greatneſs, and his mighty hand, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Oh Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou haſt begun to ſhew thy ſervant thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thy mighty hand, I pray thee let me go over, and ſee the good land that is beyond</hi> Jordan: as if he ſhould ſay, thou haſt brought me through all the difficulties and dangers of the Wilderneſs, thou haſt begun to make way to thy Peoples entrance into, and poſſeſſion of this good Land, and muſt I now, when ſo nigh unto it, and in ſuch a fair way with the reſt of thy people to come to the poſſeſſion and injoyment of it, yet be cut off, and never come to it? The loſs of falling ſhort of a mercy, when a man comes nigh to it, and is under peculiar advantages for the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, troubles more than the non-injoyment of the ſame, ot like Mercy, when a man is under no probability, or hath no peculiar advantages ever to in joy it. Hence to be nigh to, or under peculiar advantages for the injoyment of any mercy, quickens to diligence in the uſe of means, that we may not then fall ſhort of it, but may actually injoy it. And this
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106622:33"/>holds true whether the mercy reſpects a mans ſelf, or his Children, or near Relations. Now I ſay the Children of Believers are near to, and under more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar advantages for the injoyment of the Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and bleſſings of the Covenant, than the Seed of others are: Parents have (as I may ſo ſpeak) ſome kind oſ hold of that grace, and thoſe bleſſings and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefics for their Children; and Children have ſome hold for themſelves: and when a man hath any hold of a good for himſelf or his, he is loth to let it go. Saith the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Fight the good fight of Faith, lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.12. The latter branch of this exhortation, <hi>viz. To lay hold on eternal life,</hi> may be taken as directive to Chriſtians what to do more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to ingage and quicken themſelves to a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proſecution of their Spiritual Warſare, <hi>they are to lay hold on eternal life:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaith the Apoſtle, which may be done by Chriſtians while in this life. There are ſeveral wayes whereby Believers may lay hold on eternal lfe, while in the World, as by an applicatory Faith, whereby they apply and appropriate the promiſes of eternal life to themſelves, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſalm.</hi> 16. ſo <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37.24. So the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. So again eternal lite is laid hold on by ardency of affection and deſire, by poſſeſſing our ſelves of the firſt fruits of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now to lay hold on eternal life theſe or the like ways puts liſe into Believers endeavours, ſo to fight this good fight of Faith, as thereby to come to the full injoyment of that life in Heaven. When a man hath got any hold of any good for himſelf or his, he will ſtrive and tug hard rather than part with it. Now I ſay Believers have ſome hold of the Grace and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106622:33"/>of the Covenant for their Children, they ſee their Children have ſome hold through the extent of the Covenant to them, hence they muſt needs be more effectually ingaged and provoked to greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in the uſe of means, that their Children may come to the actual injoyment of that Grace, thoſe bleſſings and priviledges, than they would be, had not either themſelves or Children any ſuch hold of that Grace, and thoſe bleſſings and benefits.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is the goodneſs love and kindneſs of God in extending his Covenant to their Seed, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing the ratification and confirmation of it, by the Application of the Token thereof unto them, as a ſtrong obligation upon, and motive to Parents to uſe their utmoſt diligence in order to their Childrens imbracement of the Covenant, and giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God as his People, as thereby the Kingdom of Chriſt may be inlarged and his Intereſt promoted in the World. The love and kindneſs of God, how or which way ſoever expreſt, either towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or theirs, is greatly obliging to ſincere Believers, to endeavour to their utmoſt power the promotion of the Intereſt, and inlargement of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the World. Love is of a conſtraining nature, it hath a compulſive force and power in it, <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>John.</hi> Love begets and excites love, and love is induſtrious and laborious; hence we read of <hi>the labour of love,</hi> (1 Theſſ. 1.3.) The Apoſtle gives it as the great reaſon of their ſo zealous preaching the Goſpel, that to ſome they ſeemed <hi>to be beſide themſelves,</hi> viz. becauſe <hi>the love of Chriſt did conſtrain them,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. It is true, the love that God hath expreſt towards a Believer, in the things he hath done for, and the good he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106622:34"/>to himſelf as perſonally conſidered in and by Chriſt, may and ought to have a conſtraining force upon him to live to him, and anſwerably to endeavour to his utmoſt power according to the capacity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſtands to promote the Intereſt and Kingdom of Chriſt in the World. But yet God's extending his Covenant to their Seed, and confirming it by the Application of the Token thereof unto them, muſt rationally greatly add to the compulſive force and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy that his love hath upon them, and that for a twofold reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe his love to themſelves is greatly height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby. To all he hath done for, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to themſelves, there is the addition of that Grace vouchſafed unto theirs: and the greater the love of God is, and appears to be to a Believer, the areater efficacy and power it hath to excite his love unto God, and conſtrain him to lay out himſelf for the advantage of the Intereſt and Kingdom of Chriſt in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe God's making the Seed of Believers partakers of the ſame Grace and Goodneſs vouchſafed to them, makes it alike reaſonable that they, as they grow up to years of maturity, ſhould live to him, as they themſelves deſire to do.</p>
               <p>There is a meetneſs and fitneſs that thoſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Grace and Goodneſs of God ſhould live to him. And Parents ſeeing their Children made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame Grace and Goodneſs of God that themſelves do partake of have the ſame Covenant extended to them, that is entred with themſelves, and that ratified and confirmed to them the ſame way, as it is ratified and confirmed to themſelves, they muſt needs judge it alike reaſonable, and meet that theirs
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106622:34"/>ſhould live unto God, as well as themſelves. Hence they muſt needs be more effectually ſtirred up, and provokt to uſe their utmoſt endeavours that they may ſo do. So that I ſay the Love, Grace and Good neſs of God in extending his Covenant to the Seed of his People, and ratifying and confirming it by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Token thereof to them, is a very great obligation upon, and may and ought to be improved as a powerful motive by them, to provoke and ingage themſelves to the utmoſt diligence, in uſing all means that their Children may perſonally imbrace the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and give up themſelves to God as his People, as they grow up to years of maturity, as thereby the Intereſt of Chriſt is promoted, and his Kingdom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. And yet further there are three things, the conſideration of which may and will ſtill heighten and increaſe the conſtraining efficacy and force, that the Love, Grace, and Goodneſs of God hath upon the hearts of believing Parents to move and provoke them to the afore-mentioned diligence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is the Intereſt of their Redeemer that is promoted, and his Kingdom that is inlarged thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God hath extended his Covenant and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Application of the Token thereof the Seed of Believers, with reference to this very end, <hi>viz.</hi> the increaſe and inlargement of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the World, and that in purſuance of that promiſe made to him, that he ſhould <hi>have the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for his Inheritance, and the utmoſt ends of the earth for his Poſſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That they are their own Children, thoſe that came out of their own bowels, towards whom they are to uſe the means, in order to the ends mentioned. The Love and Goodneſs of God hath a conſtraining
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106622:35"/>power upon the hearts of Believers, to do his will however revealed, or whatever reference their doing of it hath. But when the things, whereabout his will is revealed, relate to the promotion of the Intereſt and inlargement of the Kingdom of their Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer Jeſus Chriſt, and the increaſe and inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdom was deſigned by his expreſſing his love and goodneſs to them in the ways he hath done; and they are their Children the fruit of their own bodies, that are the objects of their duty, which in obedience to the will of God they are to perrorm; ſurely now the Love, Grace, and Goodneſs of God muſt needs have the greateſt efficacy and power in it, to engage, yea conſtrain them to a vigorous and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent performance of that their duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is the aggravation that the ſin of the Seed of Believers in not accepting of the Covenant, and performing the conditions of it, receives from their precedent Covenant-ſtate, further to oblige and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Parents, who own that their Covenant-ſtate, and have applyed the Token of the Covenant on the account thereof, to endeavour to the utmoſt of their power, that they may accept of and perform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it. Not to accept of the Covenant, but on the other hand to reject it, is a greater ſin in thoſe, that have a precedent intereſt in it, than in thoſe that have no ſuch intereſt. It was a greater ſin in <hi>Eſan</hi> to deſpiſe his Birth-right and Bleſſing, then the bare not taking hold of the Covenant was to thoſe that had no ſuch birth-priviledg. To deſpiſe or reject a good granted, is more than the bare not receiving any good offered. Now Parents conſidering how greatly the ſin of their Children will be aggravated, in caſe they perform not the conditions of, but on the other hand
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106622:35"/>reject the Covenant, and conſequently that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation will be greater than the condemnation of others, muſt needs ſtrongly oblige, and more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually provoke them to greater diligence in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their duty towards them, in order to the preventing their rejection; and on the other hand in order to their accepting and performing the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is the reference that Parents faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their duty towards their Children hath to their Childrens preſervation in their Covenant-ſtate, and conſequenly injoying the full good and benefit thereof, as they grow up to years of maturity, as a farther obligation upon, and motive to provoke them thereunto. God hath taken the Seed of Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with himſelf, as they are their Seed, and continues their Covenant-ſtate during their Infancy, on the account of their Parents Faith. But when they grow up to years of maturity, the condition of their continuance in that Covenant-ſtate and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in joying the bleſſings of the Covenant, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon themſelves; they muſt in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons imbrace and take hold of the Covenant, and perform the conditions of it, which that they may do, God requires their Parents to teach them his way, and command them to walk in it; which duty of Parents in teaching and commanding their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is the firſt and moſt proper means appointed of God in order to their perſonal imbracement, and taking hold of his Covenant; and hence in caſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents fail in the diſcharge of their duty, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are deprived of the firſt and moſt proper means ſubſervient to their prefervation in their Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. And though it may ſeem hard to ſay, that God
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106622:36"/>will not vouchſafe other means, and bleſs them to the attaining of that end; yet this I muſt ſay, there is more depending upon Parents diſcharge of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than moſt are aware of; and that God will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe other means and bleſs them to ſupply the defect of Parents duty, is (as I judge) more than they have warrant to expect. However the depriving them of the firſt and moſt proper means muſt needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hazardous, and is uſually given as a main reaſon of ſo many of the Seed of the Righteous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wicked. And did Parents but underſtand, and ſeriouſly conſider this, how great an obligation muſt it needs be to them faithfully to diſcharge their duty towards their Children?</p>
               <p n="7">7. And laſtly, There is the diſhonour redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, by Childrens rejecting the Covenant, and falling off to ways of ſin and profaneneſs, yet farther to oblige Parents to a faithful diſcharge of their duty towards them. When men hear the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-intereſt of the Seed of Believers aſſerted, and ſee the Token thereof applyed to them, and yet after ſee them to run into the ſame wayes of ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs with the Children of others, they are apt to reflect upon God, and to charge him with unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his promiſes, or deluding the World with a ſhew of extending more Grace to Believers than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he doth. And this very thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent apoſtacies of the Seed of Believers, and their walking in the ſame ways of impiety with the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of others, though wholly groundleſsly, yet I conceive is no little ſtumbling-block in the way of thoſe whoſe judgment and practice lyes oppoſite to what hath been pleaded for. Now the preventing this diſhonour redounding unto God, and removing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106622:36"/>this ſtumbling-block out of the way of the weak, is a ſtrong obligation upon Parents to a faithful perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty towards their Children. And the laying theſe and the like obligations upon Parents to a diligent performance of that their duty towards their Children, may be one ſpecial reaſon of God's appointing the Application of the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them. And by what hath been ſaid we may ſee how much greater obligations are upon Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who own their Childrens intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and have the Token thereof applyed to them upon that account, and how many motives are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable by them to provoke and ſtir up themſelves to a faithful diſcharge of their duty towards them; than what are upon, or improveable by the contrary minded, according to their reſpective judgments and practices.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other enquiry is, whether Paedo-Baptiſts, or Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts, according to what they reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively hold with reference to their Children, have greater and ſurer ground to hope, and expect that the means uſed, or duties performed by them, ſhall be effectual and ſucceſsful; or whether the means uſed, and duties performed by the one, or the other, be more likely to prove effectual and ſucceſsful for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the ends aimed at?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now for this that the advantages ly on the ſide of the Paedo-Baptiſts will be undeniably evident by a double conſideration, which I ſhall but as it were mention, becauſe they muſt both be more fully inſiſted upon in a more proper place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider that Paedo-Baptiſts, according to what they hold with reference to their Children, have vaſtly more means to uſe in order to their converſion and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106622:37"/>imbracement of the Covenant, and giving themſelves up to God according to the tenour of it, then Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts have; they have many more motives, arguments, and incouragements to propoſe, apply to, and preſs upon their Children, than the contrary-minded have. And where the means are greater and more effectual in themſelves, their efficacy and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs may, according to the ordinary way of God's wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon men, be expected to be anſwerable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They have many promiſes both made to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with reference to their Children and houſholds, and to their Children, as under the Covenant, and of the viſible Church and Kingdom of Chriſt, beyond what the contrary-minded can according to their judgments and principles apply to themſelves or theirs: wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> promiſes, though they ſhould not infallibly ſecure Grace to all the Seed of Believers, how careful ſoever they may be in the uſe of means, and how faithful ſoever in the diſcharge of their duty towards them, yet they are vaſtly greater ground to hope for ſucceſs, than there would be, ſuppoſing no ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made either to Parents or Children. But theſe things ſhall (if the Lord will) be more cleared up hereafter. Now then let all men judge how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and unreaſonable that charge laid upon Paedo-Baptiſm is, <hi>viz.</hi> that it lays a foundation to Ignorance and Profaneneſs; and how much more juſtly that charge may be laid upon the contrary judgment and practice. We ſee Paedo-Baptiſts are under vaſtly greater obligations to a diligent uſe of means, and performance of duty in order to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of their Children, and their perſonal imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Covenant, than the contrary-minded can according to their judgment look upon themſelves as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106622:37"/>under, and have vaſtly more ground to expect that their uſe of means, and performance of duty ſhall be ſucceſsful, than they have. But let that ſuffice for the reaſons of Gods appointing the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as they reſpect the Parents, to whoſe Seed that Application is to be made.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The reaſons reſpecting the Children themſelves, to whom the Token of the Covenant is to be applyed; and thus the great reaſon is their good, benefit, and advantage. But that brings me to the ſecond grand enquiry. From what hath been ſaid, we may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee, that the rationality of this Inſtitution is not only ſecured to us by the infinit wiſdom of God inſtituting, but ſufficient reaſon for it lyes obvious to all ſerious conſiderate minds.</p>

The firſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that the Seed of Believers receive by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them declared, <hi>viz.</hi> They have thereby a ſolemn admiſſion into, and Memberſhip in the viſible Church, Kingdom, or Family of Chriſt. An Objection anſwered.

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. WHat are the Benefits, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ariſing to the Infant-feed of Believers, from the Application of the Tokens of the Covenant to them, or what good do they receive thereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That all Ordinances of Divine Original, are a ſignification and ſignal expreſſion of the good will of God unto men; and conſequently aim at, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106622:38"/>tend to the good and benefit of thoſe that are the due and proper ſubjects of them, hath been intimated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and may be alike infallibly concluded from the goodneſs, as their rationality from the wiſdom of the Inſtitutor. As for that ſpecial Ordinance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our preſent conſideration, the Apoſtles anſwer to much the ſame queſtion, put with reſpect to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, is applicable to, and may be given, as a more general ſolution of the queſtion now put, reſpective to both Circumciſion and Baptiſm, as applyed to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: the advantage they have thereby <hi>is much, and that every way.</hi> What that good and advantage is, and wherein it doth conſiſt is now to be inquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and in general, or as to the ſum and ſubſtance of it, it's threefold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, They thereby are ſolemnly admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and incorporated in the viſible Church, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Family of Chriſt, and thereupon become, to uſe the Apoſltes phraſe, <hi>Fellow-citizens of the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God.</hi> That Baptiſm now is as Circumciſion of old was, a ſolemn right for the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and admiſſion of all thoſe that are rightful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it, into the viſible Church, or body of Chriſt, is agreed on on all hands; which that the Infants we now ſpeak of are, hath been already proved, and is now taken for granted, which being granted, that they have this good and benefit by it will receive a ready acknowledgment from all, and indeed that to have a Memberſhip in the Church, or to be <hi>Fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> is a good, or advantage unto men, cannot be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally queſtioned by any, though wherein the good and advantage of it in the caſe of Infants does conſiſt, is not obvious unto all. And therefore muſt now be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106622:39"/>more throughly ſearched into, and declared. But before I proceed to that, one objection muſt be removed out of our way, which ſeems in the judgment of ſome, ſtrongly to oppoſe Infants injoyment of that priviledge, and conſequently their right to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, appointed for the ſolemn admiſſion of men into it: And it is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may be ſaid, that it may ſeem that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as ſuch cannot rightfully be admitted into, or incorporated in the viſible Church or body of Chriſt, or be of his Houſhold, and Family as viſible, and that for this reaſon: Becauſe memberſhip in the viſible Church, Body or Kingdom of Chriſt does preſuppoſe memberſhip in his inviſible Body, ſeeing to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his viſible Body, is nothing elſe but viſibly to appear to be a real member of his inviſible Body: that diſtinction of viſible and inviſible not being <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio rei, ſed tantum nominis,</hi> only a diſtinction of one and the ſame Church, <hi>à duplici modo unionis &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionis cum Chriſto capite</hi> (ſtill) <hi>interno &amp; exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no;</hi> ſo that the Church by theſe terms of viſible, and inviſible, is only diſtinguiſhed of, in regard of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain adjunct, <hi>viz.</hi> The manner or kind of union and communion that the ſeveral members it is conſtituted of, have with Chriſt the head, <hi>viz.</hi> internal, and real, or only external, or appearing: Hence all that are, or ought to be received as members of the viſible Church, they are and ought to be ſuch, as viſibly appear to have real internal Union and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt. Now it will be ſaid, that Infants as ſuch ſeem incapable of any ſuch Union, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; or ſuppoſe them ſimply, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly capable; yet whether any actually have, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which of them in particular have ſuch a Union,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106622:39"/>and Communion with Chiſt, is wholly unknown to us, and then how can they be ſaid viſibly to appear members of the inviſible Body of Chriſt? which they muſt do in caſe they have a right to memberſhip in his viſible Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to this Objection I would ſay theſe three or four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, That the difficulty of reſolving ſome doubts, that may ariſe with reference to perſons right to, or injoyment of Goſpel-priviledges, ought not to be pleaſed for the overthrowing, or diſanulling their right to them, when God hath evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them in his Word, to have ſuch a right to, or to have had, by his own approbation the actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and injoyment of them: God may have plainly revealed their right, and yet more darkly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed many things relating to that their right. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would not be wanting, would I inſiſt upon them, of Goſpel-priviledges, that the Scriptures evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declare perſons ſo and ſo qualified to have a real right to, and to have the actual poſſeſſion and injoyment of, and yet doubts of no eaſie reſolution may be raiſed with reference to their right to them, and the way and manner of their coming to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, And rather that the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Believers now, is no otherwiſe concerned in this Objection, than the caſe of the Infant-ſeed of the Church and people of God under the firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were, and it may be pleaded with equal ſtrength againſt their having been Members of the viſible Church, or Body of Chriſt then, as againſt the right of Infant-ſeed of Believers to memberſhip in the viſible Church, or body of Chriſt now; the Church
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106622:40"/>then conſtituted, and made up of the natural poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with the addition of ſome few Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites from among the Gentiles, was the viſible Body of Chriſt then, as well as the Church made up of Jews and Gentiles under the new Teſtament is. This I have ſo fully evidenced elſewhere, that nothing more need be added here, and indeed the Apoſtle in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. is ſo plain and expreſs, that the Gentiles, as converted to the Faith, <hi>are of the ſame body with the Jews</hi> under the firſt Teſtament; that to deny them to have been the body of Chriſt, is to deny the Church now to be ſo; and that the Apoſtle ſpeaks there of the viſible body of Chriſt, is undenyable, in that what he ſpeaks of the Gentiles more generally, he applyes to that Church of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.19. Each individual member of which Church that they did belong to the inviſible Body of Chriſt he would not affirm, but plainly intimates his ſuſpition of the contrary, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>ult.</hi> Yet he ſpeaks indefinitly, or univerſally of this Church as injoying this priviledg, to be of the ſame body, <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſt, that the Jews afore were of: an undoubted evidence that he ſpeaks of the body of Chriſt as viſible: ſo that the Jews, or the Jewiſh Church under the firſt Teſtament, was the viſible body of Chriſt; for the Gentiles as converted to the Faith, and gathered into particular Churches, are of the ſame body. Now it is paſt all rational contradiction, that the Infant-ſeed both of Jews, and proſelited Gentiles were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame body with their Parents: hence let it be reſolved how far, or in what ſenſe memberſhip in the viſible Body of Chriſt, and Union, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him as the Head was neceſſary, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed to their memberſhip in his viſible Body, the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106622:40"/>ſame, and no other is neceſſary, and muſt be preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Infants memberſhip in the viſible Body of Chriſt ſtill: the ſame anſwer then that will ſatisfie this Objection, as they were concerned in it, will alike ſatisfy it, as the Infant-ſeed of Believers now are concerned in it, in as much as they are equally and alike concerned in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly and laſtly, I anſwer, that it may be granted, yea, I conceive, it muſt be affirmed; that the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and that univerſally, have by vertue of the Covenant entred with them, a real and proper Union with Chriſt, and anſwerably may be looked upon, and reputed in ſome ſenſe, as Members of his inviſible body, and on that ground are to be admitted into his viſible Body, Church or Kingdom; only here, that all miſtakes may be obviated, we muſt diſtinguiſh of Union with Chriſt, it is either Political, or Phyſical:<note n="*" place="margin">It a Chriſto Eccleſia unita eſt, ut in ea unione extet exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum utriuſ<expan>
                        <am>

                        </am>

                  </note> By that Union I call Political, I intend that Union, which conſiſts in thoſe mutual Relations, wherein Chriſt and his Church ſtand rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted each to other, as King and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, Maſter and Servants, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Sheep: the <hi>ratio fundendi,</hi> or <hi>fundamentum proximum</hi> of this Union, is the mutual conſent of Chriſt, and thoſe that are thus united to him, either in their own perſons, as in the caſe of the adult, or on their behalf, by thoſe <hi>cujus juris ſunt,</hi> as in the caſe of Infants, to accept and take each other in theſe reſpective Relations; and this is that Union properly conſtituted by the Covenant.</p>
               <p>By that Union I call Phyſical, I intend a higher kind of Union, <hi>viz. cujus vinculum eſt Spiritus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106622:41"/>that which is made by the indwelling of the ſame Spirit that was firſt poured out upon Chriſt in the ſoul, which is proper to thoſe that are truly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; in regard of which, they are compared to <hi>branches,</hi> and Chriſt to a <hi>Vine,</hi> and Chriſt and they are ſaid to be <hi>one ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. or one ſpiritual body: and though it is true, that in reſpect of the adult, thoſe that have a Political Union with Chriſt, are ſuppoſed alſo to have a Phyſical Union; yet it is not neceſſary that all that have the former ſhould have the latter: Jeſus Chriſt may take men into what degree or kind of Union with himſelf he ſees meer. Now when I ſay the Infant-ſeed of Believers have a real Union with Chriſt, I mean it only of a Political, which we may call a mere relative Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he is their King, they are his Subjects; he their Maſter, they his Servants; he their Shepherd, they his Sheep: and this Union they have with Chriſt is the proper ground of their admiſſion into the Church viſible, or into the Kingdom, Family, Houſhold, or, as I may ſo ſpeak, Sheepfold of Chriſt; and that the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and that univerſally, have ſuch a Union with Chriſt, may be evidenced by a twofold argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt all thoſe, by whom, or on whoſe behalf the conditions of the Covenant are really and truly performed, have a real and true Union with Chriſt; but though not by (for that's not required of them) yet on the behalf of the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and that univerſally, the conditions of the Covenant are really and truly performed. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both Propoſitions carry their own evidence with ſo much clearneſs, that as I cannot at preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what can be replyed to; ſo I conceive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106622:41"/>of any thing for the proof of either would be ſuperfluous; ſurely the conditions of the Covenant between Chriſt, and God in him, and the Seed of Believers, being performed, though not by them, yet on their behalf, which is all one as though by them there muſt needs immediatly reſult ſuch a Union with Chriſt. Take it in all inſtances of this kind of Union, and the mutual acceptation and performance of the Covenant, or contracts by which that Union is conſtituted, and the Union it ſelf, neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and flows therefrom.</p>
               <p>Now that the conditions of the Covenant are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly performed on the behalf of the Seed of Believers, needs no other proof, than that they are Believers, whoſe Seed we now ſpeak of; it is the Faith and Repentance of Parents, that are the conditions of the Seed's acceptation into Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame Union, that the Covenant conſtitutes between Chriſt and ſome, it conſtitutes between him and all, with whom it is equally, and alike eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the Covenant conſtitutes a true and real Union between Chriſt and ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> adult Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, therefore it conſtitutes the ſame Union between Chriſt and others, <hi>viz.</hi> their Infant-ſeed, it being equally and alike eſtabliſhed with them, as it is with Believers themſelves. This argument carries its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the ſame clearneſs as the former. For though it is true, the conditions of the Covenant, as eſtabliſhed with adult Believers, differ from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, as eſtabliſhed with Infants; yet that hinders not, but that the Union conſtituted between Chriſt and them, is one and the ſame with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted between him and adult Believers. In as much as the Covenant accepts of the Parents Faith,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106622:42"/>as the condition of the Child's admiſſion thereinto, as will as the Faith of grown Perſons for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereinto; now it is the Covenant as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conſidered, and not as requiring ſuch and ſuch conditions, that conſtitutes this kind of Union between Chriſt and men, be they adult or Infants; neither can that higher kind of Union, (<hi>viz.</hi> Phyſical,) that Believers have with Chriſt, be pleaded as a prejudice to Infants injoyment of this lower kind of Union with him, ſeing neither the antecedent operations, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent indwelling of the Spirit in the ſoul, whereby that higher kind of Union is effected, are any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary to this lower kind of Union, which I call Political or merely relative, than the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the conditions of the Covenant by the adult, and the Promiſes of the Covenant appertaining to them having perſonally performed them, make ſo to be, when the conditions of the Covenant may be truly and really performed without ſuch operations of the Spirit, as in the caſe of Infants they may, and there is no promiſe of the indwelling preſence of the Spirit, as is alſo their caſe; there a political Union may be really conſtituted, and yet no higher Union granted: ſo that Infants have a real Political Union with Chriſt is evident, and indeed to grant them an intereſt in the Covenant, and yet deny them ſuch a Union, would be abſolutely contradictory. What Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons carry any appearance of oppoſition againſt what hath been now granted, yea aſſerted, ſhall be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hereafter.</p>
               <p>This I ſay at preſent, that the Infant-ſeed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers may be granted, yea muſt be affirmed to have a true and real Political, or relative Union with Chriſt the Head of the Church, which as it gives them a right
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106622:42"/>to memberſhip, ſo is a ſufficient warrant for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the actual poſſeſſion of that their right in the Church, Kingdom, or Family of Chriſt as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible here upon earth: neither are we concerned, as I conceive, to inquire, or determine how far, or in what ſenſe they may be ſaid by vertue of this Union, to be Members of the Church, or Body of Chriſt as inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeing our judgment and practice relating unto them have divine revelation for their ground and rule. This objection being removed out of our way, I ſhall now proceed to inquire, what good, benefit, or advantage the Infant-ſeed of Believers have by their memberſhip in the viſible Church, Body, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt; and it may be reduced to theſe three heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, which I ſhall but touch upon, they, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, are comprehended in, and have the benefit of thoſe prayers, that are continually made for the whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, or the Church of God in general, as it is the duty of Believers in their more general Aſſemblies, ſo of each particular Believer, to make known their requeſts unto God for themſelves, or on his own behalf, <hi>by prayer, ſupplication with thanksgiving,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. So to pray for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the Church of God in general, <hi>pray for the peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.6. By <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> we are to underſtand the Church of God in general, and as this is the duty of Believers, ſo that love both to Chriſt the head, and to the whole Body of which each in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular is a Member, that is the inſeparable effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, obliges and conſtrains them to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, hence it is but ſeldom but ſincere Saints eſpecially in their more ſolemn addreſſes unto God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:106622:43"/>in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.18. So in the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. Though the one was only making appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God for relief in a particular caſe, the other leaving his valedictory benediction with thoſe he had written to; yet <hi>Zion,</hi> or the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, ſhall not be forgotten by the one or the other. Hence there is, as I may ſo ſpeak, a ſtock of Prayers, (not treaſury of Merits) continually treaſuring up for the Church of God, in which the Infant-ſeed of Believers have their intereſt and ſhare, and this is no ſmall benefit to have ſo many thouſands, whom the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as his remembrancers, daily putting him in mind of his Covenant and Promiſes, as made with and to his Church, whereof they are Members, as well as of the Covenant and Promiſes made with, and to them in ſpecial, as the Seed of ſuch Parents: and this, if duly conſidered, might yield great comfort to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Parents, that theirs, as well as themſelves, are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented before the Throne of Grace by ſo many, who are under the promiſe of having the ear of God open to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And rather being Members of the viſible Church, Kingdom or Family of our Lord Chriſt, they have a joynt intereſt with all other members in that ſpecial providential care, that he exerciſes over his own houſe. That the work of providence is put into the hand of Chriſt by the Father, is evident; as from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of other Scriptures, ſo in ſpecial from that, <hi>John</hi> 5.22. where Chriſt himſelf tells us, <hi>that the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son;</hi> yet not ſo, as to ceaſe to work himſelf, for the Father works in and by the Son: but that the work of Providence is put into the hand of the Son,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106622:43"/>is evident; and this work of Providence, or providential care of Chriſt is twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt more general, and ſo it extends to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bounds and limits of the creation of God; no creature that received its being from God, but it is under providence, as adminiſtred by Chriſt, as all things are made by him, ſo by him do all things conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly more ſpecial, and thus the Church is the proper object of the ſpecial providential care of Chriſt; therefore he is ſaid by way of Emphaſis to be <hi>the keeper of Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 121.4. <hi>He that keepeth Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> (or as the words may be read, he that is <hi>keeping Iſrael</hi>) <hi>neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth:</hi> as we have here the ſpecial object of divine Providence, <hi>(viz.) Iſrael,</hi> that is the Church, ſo the exactneſs and ſpeciality of that providential care exerciſed towards, or over that object intimated, partly in the word <hi>keepeth,</hi> or <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that is carefully, and diligently keeping,<note n="*" place="margin">Curam ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentiam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat.</note> more fully declared in the following words, <hi>neither ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth nor ſleepeth:</hi> a man though he fall not aſleep, yet, if he ſtumber, is greatly indiſpoſed to diſcharge any work he is ingaged in: a ſhepherd though he be not faſt aſleep, as we ſay, yet, if in a ſlumber, his ſheep are expoſed to danger: but to ſhew the exactneſs of that providential care that our Lord Chriſt exerciſeth over his Church, it is here ſaid of him, <hi>nec dormit, nec dormitat, he neither ſleeps, nor ſlumbers;</hi> And hence again the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth <hi>to keep</hi> his Church, ſpeaking of it under the notion of a Vineyard, <hi>night and day,</hi> Iſa. 27.3. as his eye is alwayes open, he is alwayes awake, not in the leaſt ſlumbring; ſo his eye is alwayes upon his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106622:44"/>Church, <hi>he keeps it night and day;</hi> now night and day divide time: from all which we may ſee, that the Church is the ſpecial object of the providential care of Chriſt, the Church is his ſpecial charge, ſo his care is anſwerable towards, or over it, he exerciſes a moſt exact providential care towards or over his own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And here we may further obſerve, that as the work of Providence is put into the hand of Chriſt; ſo he imployes the Angels as his Miniſters in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration thereof, <hi>he maketh his Angels ſpirits, and his Miniſters a flame of fire,</hi> Heb. 1.7. according to their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences and natures, ſo he employs them as his Servants and Miniſters, in managing the work of Providence put into his hands; hence as the Church is the object of his ſpecial providential care, ſo the Angels perform their Miniſtery with a ſpecial reſpect to, and for the good and benefit of it; hence ſaid to be <hi>ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14. though they ſerve Chriſt in the whole work of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet they have their ſervice, and Miniſtry eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially aſſigned them, with reſpect to the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Church, and the particular members thereof, as thoſe that are to be heirs of Salvation; now the Infant-ſeed of Believers being rightful members of the viſible Church, or body of Chriſt, have the wings of his ſpecial providence ſtretched over them, and have a joynt intereſt in this ſervice, and Miniſtry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with the adult members; yea at leaſt, as ſome, if not moſt of our beſt Expoſitors underſtand that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of our Lord Chriſt in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. Infants have a more ſpecial intereſt in their Miniſtry, their ſtates incapacifying them to take any care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are more eſpecially committed to the charge of Angels; <hi>Take heed</hi> ſayes our Lord Chriſt, <hi>that ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe

               <p>Firſt, Whether this Providential care of Chriſt over his Church be extended equally and alike to all that are viſible members of it, or whether he hath not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106622:45"/>a peculiar reſpect to election, and a real work of Grace upon the heart, and conſequently, ſeing we deny Infants, as ſuch, to have a real work of Grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts, and affirm that there is an election of Grace among them, unto which ſome do, others do not appertain, whether this providential care of Chriſt be not appropriated only to the Elect among them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the reſolution of this queſtion ſeveral things might be conſidered, which yet I ſhal wave and ſhall only obſerve, that the Angels, whom our Lord Chriſt imploys as his Servants and Miniſters in the work of Providence, do act in their miniſtration, either according to a more general commiſſion and charge they have received, or elſe according to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular commands relating to the good and benefit of each particular perſon, <hi>hic &amp; nunc;</hi> and that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do act according to a more general commiſſion, as well as according to particular commands they receive from Chriſt, for the good and benefit of his Church, is not only conſonant to reaſon, but may be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from Scripture: and hence our Divines diſtinguiſh of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;<note n="*" place="margin">Miniſterium An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum eſt duplex, ordinarium, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinartum, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii Eccleſ.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi> pag. <hi>1548.</hi>
                  </note> it is either, ſay they, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary; their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miniſtry is, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by vertue, and in purſuance of their more general commiſſion; their extraordinary Miniſtry is that they perform in obedience to, and in purſuance of particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and directions they recieve from Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relating to the Church in general, or any part of it in this or that nation, or any particular member.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe we grant, that Angels have many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commands relating to the good of the Elect,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106622:45"/>beyond what they have relating to the good of the Non-elect, yet, ſo far as they perform their Miniſtry according to their more general commiſſion, they have an equal reſpect to all, without conſideration had to election, or non-election, which are ſecrets to them as well as to us; yea it may be further obſerved, that our Lord Chriſt himſelf, in the exerciſe of this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential care over his Church, hath a greater reſpect to the Non-elect Infant members, (I may add to the Non-elect adult, ſuppoſing their ways and actions do not openly proclaim the Hypocriſie of their hearts) than he hath to thoſe that are wholly Aliens (whether Infants, or adult) to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and anſwerably does give many particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to his Angels relating to their good, beyond what he gives relating to the good of thoſe that are, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, without: the truth of what is now affirmed is eſtabliſhed upon a twofold ground.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt the ordinary way of Chriſt's dealing with men, eſpecially in his outward diſpenſations towards them; he deals with them according to what they are, or appear to be, not according to what he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees they will be, or will do; hence ſayes the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Azariah,</hi> to <hi>Aſa, Judah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, the Lord is with you, while you be with him,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. Though there might be, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were, many whoſe hearts were not ſound nor upright with God, yet this promiſe is made to them in general, that while they ſhould keep with God in the obſervation of his commands, he would be with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, The other ground, upon which what hath been affirmed is eſtabliſhed, is the indefinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Apoſtle's expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. Where

                  </gap> their Infant-ſtate, are viſibly heirs of Salvation, or viſibly appear to be ſuch who ſhall be heirs of Salvation, as may further appear hereafter. And anſwerably the Angels in purſuance of their general commiſſion do miniſter to them, as eying them under that notion, <hi>viz.</hi> as heirs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo that though I deny not, but elect Infants may have a more full benefit by this ſpecial providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial care that our Lord Chriſt exerciſes over his own Family, than the Non-elect have: yet this I ſay, that the Infant-ſeed of Believers in general, or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, being admitted viſible members of his Family, and appearing as heirs of Salvation, before they have made a forfeiture of their Covenant-intereſt, have an equal intereſt in the ſervice, and miniſtration of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſo far as that is performed according to their more general commiſſion, with the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, beſides many particular ſervices done by the Angels, according to particular directions from Chriſt, beyond what the reſt of mankind, yet ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Covenants of Promiſe, have.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether this ſpecial providential care of Chriſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106622:46"/>be not extended to Elect-Infants, born unto unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as well as to thoſe that are viſible members of his Church, and if ſo, then ſuch would have the ſame benefit, that they have being admitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not to be doubted, but that our Lord Chriſt knows who are his by election, as well as by vocation, and that he hath a reſpect to them as ſuch, antecedent to their Union with him, and admiſſion into the Church viſible; but yet let theſe three things be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, That how far, or in what ſenſe ſoever the providential care of Chriſt is extended to, and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over ſuch, yet ſuppoſing the Infant-ſeed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers excluded from his Church and Family, that his care would be but particular, and not univerſal, it would reach only to the elect, and not to all their Seed, and conſequently the priviledge of the Seed of Believers would be greatly narrowed and leſſened beyond what now it is, yea, the Seed of Believers, as ſuch, would have no benefit by the ſpecial providential care of Chriſt, beyond what the Seed of others have, neither could their Parents take any comfort in, or make any improvement of the conſideration of their Seed's injoyment of this priviledge, in as much as they ſhould not then injoy it as their Seed, but only as elected, and who or whether any of their Seed were elected, each particular Believer would be uncertain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, The caſe of Infants and of the adult in this regard is one and the ſame, no doubt, but our Lord Chriſt hath a reſpect to the Elect, whether in their infancy, or as grown up, beyond what he hath to others; and yet we find the Church, and that as viſible, greatly magnified, yea even admired on the account of this priviledge, <hi>Oh Iſrael who is like unto
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106622:47"/>thee, a people ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help?</hi> Deut. 33.29. It is primarily meant of this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential care that our Lord Chriſt exerciſeth over his Church as viſible, and what is ſaid of the Church in general, is true of, and applicable to each particular member, as ſharing in the common priviledges of the whole, and therefore</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I anſwer, that neither Infants nor grown perſons, though as pertaining to the election of Grace, have an equal intereſt in, and benefit by this care of Chriſt, while <hi>ſtrangers to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael,</hi> with thoſe that are actual members of that Common-wealth; it is <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the <hi>excellency of God is over,</hi> Pſal. 68.34. This will clearly appear in the caſe of <hi>Ruth</hi> the Moabiteſs, that ſhe appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the election of Grace, will not, as I ſuppoſe, be queſtioned by any, and yet ſhall we think ſhe had the ſame benefit by this ſpecial providential care of God over his Church, antecedent to her coming <hi>to truſt under the wing of the God of Iſrael,</hi> as <hi>Boaz</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.12. that ſhe had, after ſhe was actually come? what benefit then had ſhe in that reſpect, by her forſaking her own people, and joyning her ſelf with the people of God? And as I ſaid the caſe of Inſants and of grown perſons is one and the ſame, ſo that this is no ſmall good or benefit that the Infant-ſeed of Believers have by their admiſſion into the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, above and beyond what the Seed of others that are without do injoy, that thereby they are brought under that ſpecial providential care that our Lord Chriſt does exerciſe over his Church, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. It may be farther inquired, wherein does the good or benefit of being under this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106622:47"/>care of Chriſt conſiſt? what difference is put thereby, between the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and the Infant-ſeed of others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I ſhall only ſay in general, that it is a good and benefit to be under this care of Chriſt, cannot rationally be doubted of, by any who with their hearts believe, <hi>that God hath raiſed him up from the dead, and given him to be the head over all things to the Church,</hi> though the effects thereof be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obvious unto ſenſe. Some indeed have not been aſhamed to put the queſtion, <hi>where is the God of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> not being able to diſcern any difference in his providential diſpenſations towards the righteous and the wicked: But will any man, that is initiated in the School of Chriſt, and hath learned in any meaſure to walk by Faith, and not by Senſe, infer herefrom, that either there is no providential care exerciſed over the righteous, or that they have no benefit thereby? The non-appearing unto ſenſe of any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Seed of Believers, and the Seed of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, is no rational ground for any to conclude, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there is no ſuch ſpecial care extended to, or exerciſed over the former, or that they receive no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or advantage thereby, <hi>The ways of God are in the Seas, his paths in the deep Waters; as for his footſteps they are not known,</hi> Pſal. 77.19. How many glorious deſigns does our Lord Chriſt carry on for the good of his Family, and the ſeveral members thereof, when yet, neither the time when the firſt foundation of them was laid, nor the various work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Providence in their accompliſhment, is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or obſerved, either by the men of the World, yea, or by Saints themſelves? only when they are brought to their intended perfection, they give abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106622:48"/>cauſe, to thoſe who reap the fruit of them, to admire and ſay, it was good for them that they ever had a place in that Kingdom or Family, <hi>over which is the excellency of that God, who rideth upon the Heaven of Heavens, and whoſe ſtrength is in the Clouds.</hi> Who, that hath any true knowledg of Chriſt, and hath his ſenſes at all exerciſed to diſcern between things that differ, would willingly be removed from under this ſpecial providential care of Chriſt, though it were to be ſet over the greateſt Empire in the World, yea though yet continued under that general providence, that extends to the whole Creation of God?</p>
               <p>So that, not to deſcend to particulars, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecial providence of Chriſt muſt be granted to be a ſingular good by all thoſe that will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Chriſtianity, and avow themſelves open Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</p>
               <p>Now, I ſay, the Infant-ſeed of Believers, as admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the viſible Church, Kingdom and Family of Chriſt, are under that ſpecial providential care he exerciſes over it; but now Parents by diſclaiming their Seed's intereſt in the Covenant, and refuſing on that account to admit them into the viſible Churh by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them, do, if not abſolutly, yet at leaſt what in them lyes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of this priviledge, and leave them under only that general and common providence, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed over the dark places of the earth, that are full of the habitations of cruelty, and oh that men, yea that Chriſtians ſhould become ſo cruel to the fruit of their own bodies.</p>

Some of theſe Promiſes mentioned. The full Good contained in them unfolded. That the Seed of Believers, as members of the viſible Church, do ſtand nigher to them, than the reſt of Mankind, fully proved. An exaggeration of Parents evil in rejecting their Childrens Church-memberſhip.</head>
               <p n="3">3. THirdly and eſpecially, the Infant-ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as members of the viſible Church, ſtand nigher than the reſt of Mankind do to, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably are the more eſpecial objects of, the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſaving Grace. The Promiſes I have reference to, are ſuch as theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31. That the very firſt ſpecial or ſaving Grace, I mean inherent or renewing Grace, whereby the Image of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in, and reinſtamped upon the ſoul, is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from God, and not from Man himſelf, needs no other proof, than the bare recital of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106622:49"/>that affirm it, <hi>John</hi> 3.3, 7. compared with <hi>John</hi> 1.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 10. <hi>James</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Promiſes aforementioned, and unto which I have reference, do contain and hold forth ſaving Grace, and at leaſt that <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.13. the very firſt ſpecial or ſaving Grace, is ſufficiently evident from the words themſelves; ſo from the application our Lord Chriſt makes of that Promiſe in <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. where we ſee our Lord Chriſt applyes theſe <hi>teachings of God</hi> to thoſe effectual teachings and drawings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby ſinners are brought to him, and which whoſoever do injoy, do actually come to him, and ſhal be <hi>raiſed up by him at the laſt day;</hi> that is, unto Life and Glory. And yet farther, that theſe Promiſes I now reſer unto, have their accompliſhment in New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-times, and that during the preſent admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, is undeniably ſecured both by our Lord Chriſt, and the Apoſtles interpretation and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: compare thoſe forecited Texts with <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. So that as all ſpecial, or ſaving Grace, eſpecially that firſt, whereby the ſoul is drawn and united unto Chriſt, is originally from God; ſo theſe Promiſes do hold forth and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that Grace unto ſome in New-Teſtament-times, during the preſent adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace: Now, I ſay, the Infant-ſeed of Believers, as incorporated into the viſible Church by the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Token of the Covenant to them, do ſtand nigher to theſe Promiſes than the reſt of Mankind do, and are the more eſpecial Objects of them, and conſequently they have, and (were Parents ſaithful in the diſcharge of their duty) would more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly have their accompliſhment eſpecially among them. But that we may more clearly ſee, how great
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106622:49"/>a good and advantage the Seed of Believers in this reſpect have by their memberſhip in the viſible Church, I ſhall do two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, ſhew more particularly what is the good that is contained in theſe Promiſes, and</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, prove that the Seed of Believers do ſtand nigher to them, than the reſt of Mankind. To begin with the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the good contained in theſe Promiſes is: and that is twofold, the former implyed and preſuppoſed; the latter more plainly expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the good contained in theſe Promiſes is the vouchſafement of ſuch outward means, as are ape and ſufficient, according to the ordinary dealings of God with, and his ordinary wayes of working Grace in Men, inſtrumentally to convey Grace to, and work it in the heart: theſe means in the general are the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward communication or publication of the Doctrine of Redemption, and Salvation by Chriſt. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, declaring the way of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salvation by Chriſt, as ſome ways commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the underſtanding, and applyed to the ſoul, is the means by, and through which God does ordinarily work Grace in thoſe, whoſe Salvation he intends; I mean it of ſuch whoſe capacities admit of their reception of Grace that way. Now when God promiſes Grace, he implicitely promiſes the means, by which it may, according to the ordinary way of his dealings with men, be wrought in thoſe intended in the Promiſes. But before I proceed, it may not be altogether unuſeful to remove one objection that may poſſibly ariſe in the minds at leaſt of ſome men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Poſſibly it may be ſaid, Theſe Promiſes ſeem rather to exclude than include any external means;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106622:50"/>for it is expreſsly ſaid, when theſe Promiſes come to have their accompliſhment, men ſhall not <hi>teach every one his neighbour, or his brother, ſaying, know the Lord, they ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> and that ſhall be the only teaching they ſhall have, or ſtand in need of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I ſhall only ſay two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Promiſes of the Covenant of Grace have a gradual accompliſhment: they had a lower accompliſhment under the firſt Teſtament, they have a higher and more full accompliſhment under the New, during the preſent adminiſtration: what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intendment they may have, and how accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the ages yet to come, is not without its diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to determine: Be ſure, in Heaven there ſhall be no need of outward means: <hi>Promiſſiones novi faede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris inchoantur in hac vita, implentur autem in vita fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura,</hi> Cam. in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. And therefore</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Theſe words only note a more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pouring forth of the Spirit under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, beyond what was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the firſt:<note n="*" place="margin">Non <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> pro non ſolum fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter accipitur, &amp; in altero, quod per adverſitivam opponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quaedam praeemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentia prae priori in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligitur. <hi>Glaſs.</hi>
                  </note> and the meaning is only this, as if the Lord ſhould ſay, they ſhall not only be taught of men; but my Spirit ſhall accompany the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, by means whereof <hi>they ſhall have my Law put in their minds, and written in their hearts, and ſhall know me from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> And that the Spirit of God deſigned not the excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ontward means is ſufficiently evident from our Lord Chriſt's inſtituting the Goſpel-Miniſtry, at that very time to which theſe Promiſes had a direct
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106622:50"/>reference, and were to have at leaſt a lower accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; the end of which Inſtitution, and the time of its duration, the Apoſtle expreſsly declares in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. So that though theſe Promiſes ſeem to exclude, yet they do indeed include, ſuch outward means, as whereby according to the ordinary way of God's working in, and upon men, the main good intended in them may be communicated to them. As when God commands any duty from men, that Command requires the due uſe and improvement of all means neceſſarily ſubſerving their performance of the duty commanded: ſo when he promiſes any good, eſpecially when the Promiſe is abſolute, as I conceive theſe are, in the promiſe of that good is included the neceſſary means of mans injoyment of it: ſo that when God promiſes that all the <hi>Children</hi> of his Church <hi>ſhall be taught of him, and</hi> that ſo, as <hi>to know him from the greateſt to the leaſt,</hi> and that he will <hi>put his Laws in their minds, and write them in their hearts,</hi> he does implicitely promiſe a ſufficiency of means, whereby the main Good intended may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them: and theſe means in the general, as I have ſaid, are the communication, or publication of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, at leaſt ſo far as is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and ſimply neceſſary to the working of a ſaving work of Grace in the heart. The various ways whereby the Doctrine of the Goſpel may be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated unto men, whether young or old, are not neceſſary to be inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p>The moſt proper and ordained way in reſpect of the Seed of Believers hath been already intimated to be Parental Inſtruction, though I ſhall not ſay, God hath confined himſelf to that way alone. But let it ſuffice to know in the general, that in theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106622:51"/>is included the vouchſafement of a ſufficiency of means, whereby theſe ſpiritual bleſſings may in an ordinary way be communicated to thoſe deſigned for their injoyment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, The main and principal good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in theſe Promiſes is the effectual operations of the Soirit of God in a concurtence with, and by thoſe means, together with their inſeparable Effects and Fruits, theſe Promiſes, both as at firſt given forth by thoſe two Prophets, and alſo as interpreted by Chriſt and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> evidently intend ſome good beyond the bare vouchſaſement of outward means; for otherwiſe they would aſſure of nothing, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ends whereunto they were given forth, beyond what was injoyed by the people of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Teſtament; they had then <hi>the Oracles of God committed to them,</hi> as well as the Church of God now hath; ſo that it muſt needs be, ſome good that is princepally intended in theſe Promiſes, beyond what was vouchſafed to the Church under the Old-Teſtament-adminiſtration, and which does advance the New-Teſtament-adminiſtration to an excellency and glory above that of the Old, which can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the more plentiful effuſion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and his effectual Operations with their inſeparable Fruits and Effects, here declared to be the ſaving knowledg of God, the abiding of the Law in the mind, and its Inſcription in the heart. But let that ſuffice for the good intended in theſe Promiſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, That the Seed of Believers, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, ſtand nigher than the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, (I mean, that are, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, without to) and are the more eſpecial Objects of theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: Now this will appear two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:106622:51"/>1. Firſt more generally, from the conſideration of the more general Objects of them, and that is the Church, or Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of which the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are Members; thus in that <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of God:</hi> whoſe Children the Prophet ſpeaks of, is evident, as from the Context, ſo from that diſcourſe of the Apoſtle in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> they are the Children of <hi>Jeruſalem which is from above,</hi> that is the Goſpel-Church; and that it is meant of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church as viſible,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Chryſoſt. And that he means the Church As viſible, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what follows.</note> is evident from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.11. It is the Church <hi>toſſed to and fro with Tempeſt,</hi> that is, Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are only compatible to the Church as viſible. Now they are the Children of the Church, as ſo conſidered, that are the Objects of this Promiſe, <hi>they ſhall be taught of God,</hi> and that ſo, as to <hi>know him from the leaſt to the greateſt.</hi> Some indeed have underſtood by theſe Children, the natural Children of the Church, or of the Members of the Church: and though I doubt not, but that the Holy Ghoſt has a conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto them, yet I conceive not merely as ſuch, but as Members of the viſible Church, it being uſual in Scripture to ſpeak of the Church collectively taken, under the notion of a Mother, and the ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers under the notion of her Children: and that we are ſo to underſtand it in this place, is evident both from the Context, and that diſcourſe of the Apoſtle before mentioned; ſo that let it be granted that this Promiſe does not appertain to the Seed of Believers merely as ſuch; yet as the Covenant of Grace is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them, and they, by the Application of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106622:52"/>the Token thereof are admitted into the viſible Church, ſo it does appertain, yea in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner appertains to them: ſo again in that <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.11. the Covenant wherein theſe Promiſes <hi>of putting the Law in the mind, and writing it in the heart,</hi> are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as made with <hi>the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> and by Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we are again to underſtand the viſible Church, that term Houſe being frequently applyed to the viſible, but never, as I remember, to the inviſible Church, at leaſt merely as ſuch: Now the Seed of Believers being of this <hi>Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> they have a joynt intereſt in this Covenant, and the Promiſes contained in it, with the whole Houſe, and anſwerably ſtand nigher to, and are the more eſpecial Objects of theſe Promiſes, than the reſt of Mankind are, who are not of this Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Only let it be obſerved, that though the Church or Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> be the proper Object of theſe Promiſes, yet I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as excluding all others from partaking of the good contained in them: for though the actual injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that good be peculiar and proper to thoſe that are of the Church or Houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet by the very vouchſafement of it, others that were without are converted and brought into it: thoſe that God hath deſigned a place in his Houſe, are effectually taught by him, and by means thereof, are brought into it: But though God does vouchſaſe the good contained in theſe Promiſes to Forraigners as the means whereby they are brought into his Houſe; yet they in a peculiar and ſpecial manner belong to his Houſe, or to ſuch as are already in his Houſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Seed of Believers as Members thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But poſſibly ſome may ſay, If ſo be God hath made the Covenant with the Church as viſible, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:106622:52"/>therein hath promiſed not only the outward means of Grace, but the effectual operations of the Spirit in a concurrence with thoſe means; and conſequently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace as the inſeparable Fruit of thoſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Seed of Believers have this Covenant, with the Promiſes thereof extended unto them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the adult Members of the Church; then it may ſeem, either that God fails in making good his Covenant, or elſe we muſt ſay, they are all ſavingly taught of God, and have true Grace wrought in their hearts; and if ſo, we muſt neceſſarily hold falling from Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection I have in part obviated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in a fromer Treatiſe; yet let me ſpeak a little more diſtinctly to it at preſent: and for a more full anſwer to it, we muſt diſtinguiſh of the Covenant thus; It is either made with the Church in general, or with particular, Perſons, and anſwerably there are ſome Promiſes appertaining to the Church in general as a collective Body, and are to be interpreted, and underſtood in an indefinite notion; but then there are other Promiſes appertaining to particular Perſons, and are to be underſtood in a definite notion: and here we may obſerve a threefold difference between the Covenant as made with the Church in general, and the Promiſes of it as ſo made, and as made with particular Perſons, and the Promiſes of it as ſo made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, There is a difference in reſpect of the good covenanted, or promiſed as thus: the Covenant, as made with the Church in general, contains Promiſes of the firſt ſaving or ſpecial Grace, as the Promiſes I have at preſent reference unto; theſe appertain to the Covenant as made with the Church in general: but now the Covenant as made with particular perſons
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106622:53"/>contains no Promiſes of the firſt Grace, but only of conſequential Grace, ſuch as the pardon of ſin, the indwelling preſence of the Spirit, and the like, and does preſuppoſe the firſt Grace already wrought as the condition of it on Man's part, as in the caſe of the Adult, or elſe does preſuppoſe the condition of it, ſome other way performed, as in the caſe of the Infant-ſeed of Believers, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Faith of their Parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, There is a difference in reſpect of the intereſt that Perſons have in, and title they have to it, and anſwerably in the way and manner of God's performing of it, or giving the good promiſed in it: as it is made with the Church in general, ſo none have a particulsr actual intereſt in, or title to it, as taken ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally by themſelves, they have only a more general intereſt in, and title to it as Members of that Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Body with which it is made; but now, as made with particular Perſons, each one, with whom it is ſo made, hath an actual intereſt in, and title to it, as taken apart by themſelvrs, without reſpect had to their relation to the Church in general; and anſwerably as it is made with the Church in general, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a liberty to himſelf to, and anſwerably does make it good, or give the good promiſed to particular Perſons, according to the good pleaſure of his Will, in a complyance with his eternal Purpoſes, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. What may be objected againſt this, from the univerſality of the expreſſions, <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> hath been anſwered elſewhere, to which I muſt refer the Reader.<note n="*" place="margin">Infant Baptiſm from Heaven. <hi>p.</hi> 59, 60, 61. ſo alſo <hi>p.</hi> 108, 109, 110, 111.</note> But as it is made with particular Perſons, ſo it does infallibly ſecure the good covenanted and promiſed to each in particular, upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106622:53"/>of a non-failure on their part in the performance of the duties required.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, There is a difference in reſpect of the tenour of the Covenant and Promiſes thereof. As made with, or to the Church in general they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute; but as made with or to particular Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional. Yet let me ſay, that though the Promiſes of the Covenant, as made with the Church in general, are abſolute as to the Church, as ſo conſidered, that is, no Condition is impoſed upon the Church in general, or as collectively conſidered, in order to God's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good theſe Promiſe; yet that hinders not, but that ſomewhat of duty may be required of particular Members in order to their own or theirs injoying the good promiſed, in which failing, either themſelves, or theirs may be denyed that good, though yet the Promiſes ſhall have their accompliſhment, and others ſhall injoy the good of them, though they do not. But to return, having then diſtinguiſhed of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Promiſes of it, the anſwer to the foregoing objection is this: That the Promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our preſent conſideration do appertain to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as made with the Church in general, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably are to be interpreted, and underſtood in an indefinite notion, and have their accompliſhment among thoſe to whom in general they do appertain according to the good pleaſure of God, in a comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his eternal Purpoſes and Decrees.</p>
               <p>Promiſes of a like nature with theſe frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in Scripture, the conſideration of which, may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear up what hath been ſaid. See <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18. <hi>John</hi> 14.12. which Promiſes, though they may ſeem to be definite as made to each particular Believer, yet are to be underſtood indefinitely, and have their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106622:54"/>accompliſhment, in that ſome have had a power of working Miracles, or in that ſuch a power hath been exerted in the Church, though poſſibly not in the fulneſs of it, by any one particular Believer: So in our preſent caſe, the Covenant as made with, and Promiſes as made to the Church or Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a Collective Body being indefinite, they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly ſecure the good contained in them to every individual Member, only ſuch a good to the Church in general, and anſwerably every individual Member ſtands night to, and is a more eſpecial object of them, than thoſe that are without.</p>
               <p>And yet for the farther clearing up and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what hath been ſaid, we may obſerve, that that twofold Good before mentioned, intended in theſe Promiſes, is diſtinctly promiſed to the Church as a Collective body.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, For the outward means of Grace thus, in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.17. <hi>He hath ſhewed his Judgments unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>and his Statutes unto</hi> Iſrael: <hi>he hath not done ſo to every Nation.</hi> I conceive we are to take theſe words, not barely as Hiſtorical of what God did for the Church of the Jews, but Promiſſory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God does graciouſly ingage himſelf, to vouchſafe ſuch outward means to his Church throughout all ages, as ſhall be ſufficient through the concurring operations of the Spirit to convey the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of himſelf in Chriſt to, and work Grace in the hearts of the ſeveral Members thereof; however, this ſeems evident, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks not of God's ſhewing his Judgments to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and Statutes to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> as a Priviledge peculiar and proper to the Jewiſh Church, but as the Church of God, and anſwerably declares what is one of the great Priviledges of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106622:54"/>Church throughout all ages, <hi>viz.</hi> to injoy <hi>the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God,</hi> or the outward means of Grace: And hence it is, that the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> as then not unchurched, that <hi>it was neceſſary,</hi> or of neceſſity, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>the Goſpel ſhould be firſt preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi> Acts 13.46. and why was this neceſſary or of neceſſity, but becauſe they, yet appertaining to the viſible Church, ſhould, while they ſo continued, have a ſufficiency of outward means, whereby the ſaving Knowledg of God in Chriſt, and a work of Grace might be communicated to, and wrought in them, God having granted that to his Church as one of her great Priviledges here upon earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, For the effectual operations of the Spirit, with their inſeparable Fruits and ſffects: and thus our Lord Chriſt hath promiſed the conſtant and perpetual preſence of the Spirit in, and with his Church, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</hi> John 14.16. We are not to underſtand this as a Promiſe to particular Believers; though in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Spirit of God doth dwell, he dwells and abides for ever; yet of that indwelling preſence of the Spirit in the hearts of particular Believers I conceive our Lord Chriſt does not here ſpeak, but of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in, and with his Church in general, in which ſenſe Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to walk in the midſt of the golden Candleſticks:</hi> Now the great end of the Spirit's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in, and with the Church is to make effectual by his internal operations the external means of Grace for the ends whereunto they are vouchſaſed; ſo that we ſee the Promiſes of ſaving Grace, both of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means whereby that Grace is wrought, and of the Spirit by whoſe operations thoſe means are made
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106622:55"/>effectual, do in a particular and ſpecial manner apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the viſible Church, and conſequently the Seed of Believers being Members thereof, they muſt needs ſtand nigher to, and be more eſpecially the Objects of thoſe Promiſes, than the reſt of Mankind, who are <hi>Aliens from the Commonwealth of Iſrael:</hi> and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it can be no ſmall benefit, or advantage to ſtand in ſo nigh a capacity to theſe Promiſes, to be of that Body, or Family to whom they do belong, though the good contained in them be not infallibly ſecured to every individual. To be of any Body Politick, Corporation or Society, unto which any peculiar Grants do belong, is looked upon as a great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Advantage, though the Good granted be not infallibly ſecured to every individual Member; yet every one in particular is in a nigher and greater capacity to injoy that Good, than thoſe that are not of ſuch a Body, Corporation, or Society: the caſe is the ſame here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, and more particularly: And thus we ſhall find, that theſe Promiſes do yet in a more eſpecial and peculiar manner belong to that part of, or ſpecies of Members in the viſible Church that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Seed of Believers: the Adult are ſuppoſed already to have the firſt Grace; and therefore, theſe Promiſes, at leaſt as they hold forth the firſt Grace, have a more eſpecial reſpect to the Seed of Believers: Hence we ſhall find Promiſes of that twoſold Good before mentioned expreſsly and particularly made unto them: thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.4, 5. Sayes the Lord, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my bleſſing upon thy Off-ſpring.</hi> Seed and Off-ſpring here are ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous terms, they intend the ſame Subjects, and by both the natural Seed of Believers is intended, as is evident, in as much as that term Off-ſpring is never
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106622:55"/>uſed in any other ſenſe, than to ſignify natural Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Poſterity, and by Spirit and Bleſſing the ſame good is intended, only the latter term is explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the former, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> is as much as to ſay, I will pour out my Spirit, who, as poured out upon, ſhall be a bleſſing to them; and in this promiſe of the Spirit is implyed the vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafement of the outward means, through and by which God does pour out his Spirit upon his People. The Doctrine of the Goſpel as ſome way communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, is the miniſtration of the Spirit to them; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. And hence the Promiſe of the Spirit does neceſſarily imply, and include in it, ſuch a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Goſpel, as through which, according to the ordinary way of God's dealing with men, the Spirit may be miniſtred to thoſe to whom the Promiſe doth appertain: and as the Spirit is here expreſsly promiſed to the Seed of Believers, and the outward means of Grace implyed therein, ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. <hi>ult.</hi> this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold good is exprefsly, and <hi>in terminis</hi> promiſed, <hi>My Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed's Seed, from henceforth, and for ever, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It is a promiſe made to the univerſal Church, and declares the way, and means how, and whereby God does uphold, maintain and perpetuate his Church in the World, it is by vouchſaſing his Word, or the outward means of Grace, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in a concurrence with them, to his People, and their Seed ſucceſſively from one generation to another. To thoſe that conſider the nature of theſe Promiſes, or that they are tobe interpreted and underſtood not in a definite, but in an indefinite notion, and do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106622:56"/>obſerve the way of God's procedure in the diſpenſation of his Grace towards men, any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to vindicate the Faithfulneſs of God in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance would be needleſs and ſuperfluous; for though ſome have contemned that obſervation that others have made, <hi>viz.</hi> that that Seed that God hath reſerved out of the poſterity of fallen man to ſerve him, is in a conſiderable meaſure raiſed out of the Families of the Faithful, yet it is indeed of great weight, and ſo evident to unbyaſſed Obſervers, that it may be no little confirmation of the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now given of theſe Promiſes, and is an abundant vindication of the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God in them.</p>
               <p>And as it hath in all ages paſt given, ſo ſtill gives him the juſt Name and Repute of a God <hi>keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Mercy for ever.</hi> But to put a cloſe to this third Benefit that the Seed of Believers have by their Memberſhip in the viſible Church, I ſay they are thereby brought nigher to the Promiſes of ſaving Grace, than the reſt of Mankind are: they are oſ that Collective Body or Society of men unto whom theſe Promiſes do in the general appertain; and not only ſo, but are that ſpecial part of, or ſpecies of Members in that Body or Society, to whom theſe Promiſes in a more eſpecial manner do belong: they are nigh to the Promiſes as they are of the viſible Church, but they are yet nigher, as they are ſpecified and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out to be the Perſons peculiarly intended in them: and according to their nignneſs to theſe Promiſes, ſo eſpecially, when Parents are faithful in their duty towards them, is their injoyment of the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>romi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. How rarely is it found when Parents with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> are faithful in inſtructing, <hi>and commanding their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106622:56"/>Children to walk in way of the Lord;</hi> but if not all, yet ſome, (though ſometimes more ſometimes ſewer, according to the number they are bleſſed with) are found through the bleſſing of God accompanying of thoſe inſtructions walking in theſe ways; yea, how many inſtances might be given of Parents ſo perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty, who can walk in the World, as in a ſtrange land with comfortable hopes that all theirs are <hi>heirs with them of the ſame Promiſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then, how ſtrange is it that believing Parents ſhould have their underſtandings ſo far darkened, and their Judgments ſo far blinded, to make that which ſometimes was the Gentiles, and is now the Jewes miſery, (viz. <hi>to be far from God, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Covenants of Promiſe</hi>) their choice, though not for themſelves, yet for theirs; and ſhould, what in them lies, ſet them at the utmoſt diſtance from thoſe Promiſes that are the great grounds of hope to fallen Man, that he may Obrain an exchange of his Sin and Miſery for Grace and Glory, and leave them to take their Lot among thoſe that are afar off? We may well call to the Heavens <hi>to be aſtoniſhed at this, and to the Earth to be moved out of its place.</hi> But to paſs from this firſt Head of Benefies accruing to the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: From the application of the token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them they have admiſſion into, and become Members of the Church viſible; and God by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Seed of his People, ſpeaks to them with reſpect to their Seed, as <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> with reference to his two Sons, <hi>Bring your Children near to me that I may bleſs them:</hi> bring them into my Houſe and Family, and as they then ſhall have an intereſt in all the Prayers put up for it; ſo they ſhall have the ſpecial providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106622:57"/>care of my Son over them, he ſhall give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels a charge concerning them, they ſhall come into a nigher capacity to injoy Grace promiſed, than the reſt of Mankind; and be you faithful in your duties, and I will be faithful in my Promiſes. Now ſhall any reject ſuch a Gracious Invitation, how juſtly may Children cnrſe the day they were ever brought forth by ſuch Parents?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The ſecond Good or Benefit accruing to the Seed of Believers by the Application of the Token of the Covenant propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> They have thereby the Covenant, with the Promiſes thereof appertaining to them, ratified ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed. An Enquiry made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Covenant and Promiſes are entred with, and made to the Seed of Believers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly or only indefinitly. The various judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Paedo-Baptiſts about it. That they are entred and made definitely, proved two wayes. Firſt, In the inſtance of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed immediatly proceeding from his own Loyns: where two Reaſons are offered. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It is further proved by three Reaſons reſpecting both <hi>Abraham's</hi> and all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Seed. The forementioned good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing to the Seed of Believers opened in the reſolution of two Queſtions. The former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>viz.</hi> What the Token of the Covenant has reference unto. That it has a twofold reference ſhewed. Firſt, To the Covenant as abſtractly and abſolutely conſidered. The thing ratified, ſealed and confirmed by it,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106622:58"/>as conſidered in that its reference, determined to be their Covenant. That the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of which is proved by two Arguments to be their diſcharge from the guilt and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of Originalſin, and that both <hi>Originans</hi> and <hi>Originatum.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="2">2. THe ſecond Good or Benefit, that the Seed of Believers have by the Application of the Token of the Covenant, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> They have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Covenant with the Promiſes thereof appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them ſealed and confirmed to them. But before I proceed to a particular unfolding of this Good or Benefit, it may not be unuſeful, but ſeems neceſſary, that I ſhould give a brief account of the different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Poedo-Baptiſts themſelves about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Covenant and Promiſes, as entred with, and made to the Infant-ſeed of Believers; for that they are not all of one mind and judgment about that muſt be granted: And according to their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehenſions about the nature of the Covenant and Promiſes, they are differently perſwaded as to the Good accruing to Infants by their Covenant-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and their having the Token of the Covenant applyed to them, which I ſhall alſo briefly take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of as I go along.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Some concerve that the Covenant is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with the Seed of Believers only indefinitly, and anfwerably that the Promiſes appertaining to them are to be interpreted and underſtood in an indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite notion; that is, as having a reſpect to them as generally and collectively conſidered, but not made to any of them in particular. And of thoſe that go this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106622:58"/>way, ſome conceive that the Covenant and Promiſes appertain only to the Elect, and ſecure to them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the future injoyment of all the ſaving Fruits and Benefits purchaſed by Chriſt; but do not neceſſarily convey to, or confer upon them any of thoſe Fruits or Beaefits for the preſent, and conſequently, that by the Application of the Token of the Covenant, only <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> not <hi>Jus in re</hi> is ſealed and confirmed: But others conceive that as the Covenant and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof have only an indefinite reſpect to the Seed of Believers, ſo that at leaſt ſome of them have thoſe ſaving Benefits and Bleſſings actually granted to and conferred upon them, and conſequently that they are actually regenerated, and have a full and compleat Union with Chriſt, the Remiſſion of ſins, the Love and Favour of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſome having there Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Bleſſings actually conferred upon them in their Infance, we are to preſume it may be ſo with each one in pqrticular; and on that ground are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Token of the Covenant to them univerſally. And this Opinion, could it be clearly proved from Serip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would free the Controverſie about Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm from many difficulties it muſt be confeſt it is otherwiſe attended with: And on that account I ſhould readily comply with it: but for the reaſons after to be given, I cannot, but at preſent lay it aſide <hi>cum pace tantorum virorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, others conceive that the Covenant is entred with the Seed of Believers definitely, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably that the Promiſes appertaining to them are to be interpreted and underſtood in a definite notion; and conſequently, that as the Covenant, as at firſt eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> did extend to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> as well as to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo is ſtill continued to all Believers,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106622:59"/>and each one of their Seed in particular. And ſome of theſe that go this way conceive, that all the Infants of Believers have true Grace, in particular true Faith, wrought in them either antecedent to the Application of the Token of the Covenant, or at the time of its Application, if not by, yet in a concurrence with it. But this opinion neceſſarily inferring a poſſibility to loſe, and fall from the truth of Grace, is rejected by the generality of Proteſtants, eſpecially that bear the denomination of <hi>Calviniſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet ſome grant, yea aſſert ſome kind of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Operations of the Spirit to antecede, at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them, whereby at leaſt a <hi>poſſe agere,</hi> or ſome diſpoſitions facilitating their ſaving acting of Grace are wrought. But others diſtinguiſh of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: it is ſay they, <hi>internum, out externum,</hi> it is either Internal, or External: by the Internal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they ſeem to mean the Covenant as really and truly entred with the Elect, enſuring to them Grace and Glory: by the External Covenant they ſeem to mean the Covenant as viſibly appearing to be made with Men, whether Infants, or Adult, when as it is not indeed really entred mutually between God and them. This latter way of God's entring Covenant with Men, whether young or old, is expreſſed by ſome, by entring Covenant with them in or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to an Eccleſiaſtical Diſpenſation, that is, as they expreſs themſelves in a viſible Church-way.</p>
               <p>Again others, and ſometimes the ſame Men diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of the Good contained in and conveyed by the Promiſes of the Covenant appertaining to the Seed of Believers: it is, ſay they, either Spiritual and Saving, or elſe only External and Eccleſiaſtical; as Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106622:59"/>in the viſible Church, a right to the outward Ordinances and Priviledges of the Church, and the like. And they conceive that the Covenant, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſaving Spiritual Mercies, only appertains to the Elect; but, as containing External Eccleſiaſtical Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, it appertains to all the Seed of Believers: hence they call it, as entred with them, a Covenant of Priviledges. This latter Opinion concerning the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs of the Covenant I take to be according to truth, though to diſtinguiſh either of the Covenant, or the good contained in it, as entred with, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Infants, I ſee no ground, neither do I think it is at all neceſſary; but I ſay, as to the nature of the Covenant, I doubt not, but that it is entred with, and extended to the Infant-ſeed oſ Believers definitely, and anſwerably that the Promiſes appertaining to them are to be interpreted and underſtood in a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite notion, as appertaining equally and alike to each one in particular: I ſpeak of the Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as entred with and made to the Seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers merely as ſuch. There are, it's true, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant appertaining unto them, which are to be interpreted and underſtood in an indefinite notion, as has been afore declared; but thoſe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not to them merely as the Seed of ſuch Parents, but as Members of the viſible Church, as was there ſhewed: But now for the Covenant as extended to them as the Seed of believing Parents, ſo it is extended to them definitely, and anſwerably the Promiſes of the Covenant appertaining to them are to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and underſtood in a definite notion.<note place="margin">Infant Baptiſm from Heaven. <hi>Book 1. Chap. 2.</hi>
                  </note> This I have in part proyed already, yet I ſhall add ſomewhat morefor the further confirmation of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106622:60"/>it. And it may be, as I conceive, proved two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Children, proceeding immediatly from his own Loyns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By ſome further Reaſons equally reſpecting <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, and all other Believers Infant-ſeed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us ſee it in that particular inſtance of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Infant-ſeed; and thus I ſhall only offer theſe two reaſons, beyond what I have given in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe forecited.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unleſs the Covenant had been entred definitely with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, immediatly proceeding from his own Loyns, there had been no rational ground for <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s Circumciſion. That Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the Token of the Covenant is expreſsly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Lord himſelf; and anſwerably that the Application of it did preſuppoſe the Subjects to whom it was to be applyed to be in Covenant, at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to viſible appearance, or according to aratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment of Charity, is above any rational doubt evident. This I have alſo proved elſewhere. But now unleſs the Covenant did extend unto <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in particular, there was no appearance at all of his being in Covenant, but an undenyable diſcovery of the contrary, and that from the mouth of God himſelf: By promiſing <hi>Abraham</hi> a Son of <hi>Sarah,</hi> and that, as the Mother of that Son, ſhe ſhould be a Mother of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he did ſet aſide <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and exclude him from the number of thoſe that ſhould inherit the Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and was ſo underſtood by <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was the groud of his prayer for him, and is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly interpreted by the Apoſtle, in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. Hence had not the Covenant extended to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> in particular, there had been no ground for the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Circumciſion to him, eſpecially under that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106622:60"/>notion, <hi>viz.</hi> As the Token of the Covenant, under which notion it was yet applyed to him; he could not be lookt upon as an Heir deſigned to inherit the Good of the Promiſe now made; much leſs to have true Grace already wrought in him, ſeing he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by God himſelf from inheriting the Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. The rationality of God's extending the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to him, and granting the Token of it, when yet he intended not that he ſhould inherit the Good promiſed, is no way difficult to declare, but is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary here to be inſiſted upon. It is enough to our preſent purpoſe that he was in particular taken into Covenant as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and as the Covenant was entred with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed; ſo it is entred with all Believers, and their natural Seed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is further evident, becauſe under this term <hi>Seed</hi> in the Promiſe, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical Seed was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and included with his natural; this the Apoſtle expreſsly declares, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. Hence look under what notion the Covenant was made with the one ſpecies or ſort of his Seed, in the ſame notion it was made with the other: but now it is undenyable, that, as made with his myſtical Seed, it is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and underſtood definitly, and anſwerably was ſo made with his natural Seed. We may ſuppoſe all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s myſtical Seed, as well as his natural, then actually exiſting (as in the ſight of God they were, to whom things future are preſent,) and now ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the preſence of God, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him as ſpeaking to him with reference to them all, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of all theſe that are thy Seed:</hi> Now how can we without warrant from Scripture, as here we have none, interpret or underſtand him as promiſing to one ſpecies or ſort of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106622:61"/>this Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> definitely, that he would be a God to them; but to the other only indefinitely: So that as without great prejudice to the Faith and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Saints we cannot interpret the Promiſe as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending unto them only in a definite notion: So not without great violence to the Text can we interpret it as intending <hi>Abraham's</hi> natural Seed any otherwiſe then we do as intending his myſtical Seed. Hence whatever difficulties may be ſuppoſed to attend our expounding the Promiſe in a definite notion as exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the natural Seed of Believers, the ſame diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties did attend it as ſo made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed; and yet that it was ſo made to them, ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the reaſons now given, taken in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with what has been formerly argued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly let me yet ſurther offer ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons equally reſpecting <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Seed: and I ſhall not produce all thoſe Reaſons which offer themſelves to ſerve in the deſign in hand; I ſhall only ſingle out theſe three, which I conceive ſufficient to confirm what is now aſſerted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the Promiſes of the Covenant were only made indefinitely to the Seed of Believers, then there would be in variety of inſtances an abſolute failure on God's part in the performance of them: This appears thus, as indefinite Promiſes do not infallibly ſecure the Good contained in them to every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom in common with others they do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: So they do infallibly ſecure that Good, at leaſt to ſome one, if not more, of thoſe to whom in general they are made. Suppoſe a man come to another and ſay, I will do good, or I will be bountiful to you and to your Children; ſuppoſe he ſhould do good or be bountiful according to the utmoſt intent of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106622:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>only to the man himſelf, but wholly neglect, or do no good at all to any one of his Children; he would hardly be accounted a man faithful to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: the Promiſe being only an indefinite Promiſe, would not its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> oblige him to do good or extend his bounty to every individual Child, yet to ſome one or more it would. But now that all Believers have ſome one or more of their Seed immediatly proceeding from their own Loyns partaking with them in the Spiritual and ſaving Benefits and Bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, I ſuppoſe cannot be affirmed; the contrary is too evident in ſeveral inſtances; and how God with reſpect to ſuch can be ſaid to be a God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, I cannot apprehend, ſuppoſing the Promiſes be only indefinite.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Promiſes appertaining to the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers were only indefinite, then they would pertain to them when Adult, yea, let their ways and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices be what they will, as well as while in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; and anſwerably it may ſeem they would have the ſame right to the Token of the Covenant then, that they have in their Infant-ſtate. That the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would equally and alike appertain to them when Adult, as when Infants, yea let their ways and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices be what they will, muſt as I conceive be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily granted: for they appertain to them either as the Seed of ſuch Parents, or as performing the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant themſelves: not the latter, for then none of the Seed of Believers would have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them till themſelves had Grace; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Grace would not be given in a purſuance of the Promiſes, but muſt precede their mtereſt in them: and therrfore they muſt needs appertain to them as the Seed of ſuch Parents; and conſequently muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106622:62"/>appertain to them while they are ſuch, which they are when grown up, as well as when Infants, be their lives and converſations what they will: and while the Promiſes appertain to them, eſpecially while they viſibly and apparently appertain to them, they ſeem evidently to have a right to the Token of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> And if any ſhall ſay, that will not follow; for the Promiſes of the Covenant may indefinitely apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to thoſe, who yet by their wickedneſs may forfeit their right to the Token of the Covenant, in as much as their right to it does ſuppoſe them to have the truth of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſw.</hi> To that I would ſay two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That I conceive, that it is intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſes thereof that gives right to the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: <hi>Be Baptized, for the Promiſe is to you and to your Children,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. He ſeems evidenly to ground his Exhortation to them to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, upon their intereſt in the Promiſes. But for this ſee more in my firſt Treatiſe concerning Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>Pag.</hi> 263. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That in reſpect of the Seed of Believers, ſuppoſing the Promiſe indefinitly appertaining to them, it may be charitably hoped they may have the truth of Grace, and conſequently a real Union with Chriſt, though greatly apoſtatizing from the ways of Grace and Holineſs, and at preſent walking in the ways of ſin and ungodllineſs: This hope may be rationally grounded upon the Promiſe appertaining to their (I ſpeak upon that ſuppoſition, that they do appertain to them indefinitely, and that God in a purſuance of them doen ſo frequently work Grace in the hearts of the Seed of his People, as is a rational ground for the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106622:62"/>Application of the Token of the Covenant to them univerſally in their Infancy with reſpect to Grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wrought) taken in conjunction with the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable experiences of all ages, that thoſe who have a real work of Grace may greatly apoſtatize from the ways of Grace and Holineſs, and ſometimes be found walking, and that for a great while (how long 'tis hard to ſay) in the ways of ſin and ungodlineſs, is paſt all rational doubt in variety of inſtances; as that of <hi>Solomon</hi> and others. And if ſo be this ſuppoſition, that God has wrought Grace in this or that Infant, be a ſufficient ground to apply the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them in their Infancy; why may not the ſame Judgment of Charity be exerciſed towards the ſame, Perſons, as grown up, though at preſent great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apoſtatized from the ways of Grace and Holineſs, and ſuppoſing the Promiſes alike appertaining to them, as they did in their Infancy, and the ſame Judgment of Charity to be exerciſed towards them as may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed during their Infant-ſtate? Though it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their caſe be more doubtful, yet I ſay it will be hardly proved by Scripture that they ought not to have the Token of the Covenant applyed to them; and yet to grant them this priviledge, their caſe being as now put, will be attended with no ſmall inconveniency.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Promiſes are made only indefinitely to the Seed of Believers, then they ſeem evidently to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain alike to their mediate as to their immediate Seed. In <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe 'tis undeniable, that, as taken in an indefinite notion, they did equally and alike appertain to his Seed and Poſterity mediately deſcended from him, as to his immediate Seed: neither had his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Seed any other intereſt in them then his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate. Now the Apoſtle tells us expreſsly <hi>that the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106622:63"/>bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>is come upon believing Gentiles;</hi> or ſuppoſe we can from any Scripture-warrant limit the Promiſes as made only to the immediate Seed of Believers under the New Teſtament, yet ſeeing we cannot limit them to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s immdeiate, but muſt grant them equally and alike to reſpect, and be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his mediate as to his immediate Seed, it will certainly follow, that all the Seed of the <hi>Jews</hi> to this very day, have an equal and alike intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and the reſt of both <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s and <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Children had. And if ſo, I conceive, no reaſon can poſſibly be aſſigned, why the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity may not be exerciſed towards theſe, as was exerciſed towards them; and conſequently they would be as due and proper Subjects of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant as they were, and ought to have it applyed unto them: And if ſo be we cannot limit the Promiſe to the immediate Seed of Believers, as I much think we cannot, in caſe we grant them to be only indefinitely made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed; then there will be laid a fair ground for the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Token of the Covenant, which now is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to all Infants univerſally, as may be eaſily ſhewed if neceſſary. But I ſhall not inlarge upon this. Theſe reaſons convince me paſt all rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that the Covenant and Promiſes thereof neither were entred with, nor made to either the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other Believers in a mere indefinite notion: but however God might have and ſtill has a more general reſpect both to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s and all Believers Seed mediately deſcending from them reſpectively; yet as entred with and made both to his and their immediate Seed; ſo they are to be interpreted ad underſtood in a definite notion,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106622:63"/>reaching and taking in each one of their Seed in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. This Queſtion being reſolved, I ſhall now proceed to the Application and unfolding of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Benefit aſſigned to the Infant-ſeed of Believers by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them: and here two things are to be enquired into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What the Token of the Covenant has reference to; or what it is that is ratified ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to Infants thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherein the Good Benefit and Advantage of having that (whatever it be) that the Token of the Covenant hath reference unto, ratified ſealed and confirmed by an outward Sign and Token does conſiſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt, And thus the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant has a double reference. Firſt, To the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it felſ, as more generally and abſolutely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Secondly, To the particular Promiſes contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, the Token has reference to the Covenant it ſelf, as abſolutely and more generally conſidered: And hence, that which is firſtly and primarily ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified ſealed and confirmed to Infants (and the ſame is true of the Adult) by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them, is the Covenant it ſelf, as more generally and abſolutely conſidered; and conſequently, and as the immediate and neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult thereof, that which is Ratified and Confirmed is their Covenant-ſtate, They are (as I may ſo ſpeak) ſolemnly inveſted and ſealed in a Covenant-ſtate with God; they are abſolutely <hi>de preſenti</hi> removed from under the firſt Covenant entred with all Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſolemnly inveſted with, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated into a new Covenant-ſtate. Hence Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106622:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>(and the ſame is true of Baptiſm) is ſaid to be <hi>the Token of the Covenant,</hi> as abſolutely conſidered, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.11. as the one had, ſo the other has a firſt and primary reſpect and reference to the Covenant as abſolutely taken; and conſequentially to the ſtate of thoſe that are taken into Covenant; they are thereby ſolemnly put, and ſetled in a new Covenant-ſtate and relation Godward: though I deny not, but that the new Covenant or Covenant of Grace is conditionally made with all, or rather offered to Mankind; there is an offer and tender of Chriſt with all his Benefits to all men upon condition of Faith and Repentance: <hi>Go,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>preach the Goſpel to every Creature: he that believes and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believes not, ſhall be damned,</hi> in that <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15, 16. But <hi>condionale nihil ponit in uſu.</hi> A conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Covenant, though it makes a great alteration in the caſes of Men, they are not now under a neceſſity of ſtanding or falling according to the tenour or terms of the firſt Covenant; yet that does not change their ſtate, they are yet Heirs of the curſe denounced in caſe of the tranſgreſſion of that Covenant; they are yet <hi>Children of wrath, the wrath of God abideth upon them,</hi> John 3.36.<note n="*" place="margin">Non dixit ir a Dei veniet ad eum, ſed ir a Dei manet ſuper eum. Omnes qui naſcuntur mortales habent ſecum iram Dei. Quam iram Dei? quam exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit primus homo <hi>Adam Auguſt.</hi> in loco.</note> But the Seed of Believers are actually received into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, ſolemnized, ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed by the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them and from this change in their ſtates I conceive a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and immunity from the condemning power of Original ſin, whether <hi>originans</hi> or <hi>originatum,</hi> does neceſſarily
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106622:64"/>ariſe and reſult unto them. How far or in what ſenſe Mankind in general is freed from the ſanction of the firſt Covenant by the new Covenant, as made conditionally with all Men, is not abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me to decermine, and I ſhall endeavour to wave all controverſies excentrical to my preſent deſign: this ſeems evident, that however others are, yet all thoſe that are actually under the Covenant of Grace, as definitely entred with them, are <hi>de preſenti</hi> freed from it. ſeing there is an abſolute inconſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween being under the Law, and under Grace, at one and the ſame time. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom,</hi> 6.14. ſets theſe two States in a direct antitheſis or oppoſition the one to the other; whether we underſtand by Law here, the Moſaical Law, or the Law as given at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> wherein there was a reveal of the Law of Works made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, or that firſt Law or Covenant as ſo made with <hi>Adam;</hi> yet by Grace I conceive we muſt underſtand the Covenant of Grace, and them 'tis all one as to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: no man can be under two Covenants that are in nature or kind directly oppoſite the one to the other, at one and the ſame time. Hence I ſay, the Infants of Believers, being under the Covenant of Grace, they muſt needs be ſet free from the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the ſame ſenſe that all Believers are; and as for the Covenant of Grace that threatneth condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt none but either final rejecters of it, as in the caſe of thoſe that are yet ſtrangers to it, or total and final violators of it, as in caſe of thoſe that are actually under it, and being free from the ſanction of the firſt Covenant, and not under any obligation to ſuffer future condemnation, either as rejecters, or violators of the ſecond, I conceive their immunity
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106622:65"/>from the condemning power of Original ſin, yea of whatever ſin, whether Original or Actual they fall under the guilt of, during their pure Infant-ſtates, muſt neceſſarily enſue, though no expreſs Promiſe of parden (which I conceive it is not neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after) ſhould appertain unto them, <hi>ceſſante ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatione legis &amp; non obligante novo foedere,</hi> there can be no condemnation to them on the account of any ſin chargeable upon them. The ſum of what has been ſaid may be reduced into this Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. All thoſe that are neither under the curſe of the Law, nor under the curſe threatned in the firſt Covenant, nor condemnable by the Covenant of Grace, muſt needs be free from the condemning power of Original ſin, yea of any ſin they are at preſent chargeable with: but ſuch is the caſe of the Infant-ſeed of Believers, during their pure Infant-ſtate: therefore during that ſtate, they are free from the condemning power of Original ſin, yea of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſin they, during that ſtate, are chargeable with.</p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> Propoſition will be readily granted on all hands, ſeeing fin, be it Original or Actual, receives its power to condemn, or has its <hi>ſtrength,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, from ſome Law or Covenant under which the Perſon guilty is; as where <hi>there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi> So where the Law threatens not condemnation, there is no condemnation; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation muſt be either threatned in the Covenant of Works, or the Covenant of Grace: Hence if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Laws or Covenants threaten condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto men for any ſin they are guilty of, their ſin has not power to condemn them, or they muſt needs be free from the condemning power of any ſin they are guilty of. So that I conceive the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106622:65"/>ſtands firm. For the <hi>minor,</hi> that is evident from what has been already ſaid: the Law threatens not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the Infant-ſeed of Believers, becauſe they are not under it; they are freed from the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, wherein future death is threatned. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace threatens not condemnation to them, becauſe they are neither Rejecters nor Violators of it: but on the other hand, the conditions of it are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, though not by them, yet on their behalf which the Covenant accepts as though performed by themſelves in their own perſons. Whence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is undeniable. Again, that the Infant-ſeed of Believers are freed from the condemning power of Original ſin, may be proved thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. All thoſe that are under the condemning power of any ſin, are in a ſtate of enmity with God, or have God as an enemy to them: but the Infant-ſeed of Believers are not in ſuch a ſtate, neither have they God as an enemy to them; therefore they are not under the condemning power of any ſin, and conſequently not of Original ſin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>major</hi> Propoſition as evident thus: God is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be an enemy unto Men, as he is obliged either in reſpect of his Eſſential Juſtice, or ſome Law given to, or Covenant made with him to puniſh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the due deſert of ſin. God is not an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Man merely as Man; nor yet merely as vitiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrupted with ſin; for then he ſhould be an enemy to all Men; yea to the regenerate as well as the unregenerate: but he is an enemy as under an obligation to puniſh according to the due deſert of ſin. Hence, he is an enemy to all thoſe, and to thoſe only, whom he is according to their preſent ſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions obliged ſo to puniſh. Now while any are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106622:66"/>under the condemning power of ſin; that is, have the guilt of ſin remaining upon them, God is under an obligation to puniſh them according to the due deſert of their ſin; I ſay, he is ſo while the guilt of their ſin remains upon them, guilt being removed that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ceaſeth. How God may be under ſuch an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and yet give Faith and Repentance whereby that guilt may be removed, is obvious to all, and need not here be declared: but I ſay, while guilt remains, while ſin has a power to condemn, God ſtands rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an enemy unto Men, or they are in a ſtate of enmity with him. But now, which is our <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition, the Infant-ſeed of Believers are not in ſuch a ſtate. This is not only evident from what has been already ſaid, but from the abſolute incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between a ſtate of enmity, and that mutual relation between God and them, as he is their God, and they his People, of which more by and by. Now then the Premiſes being true, the Concluſion is certain.</p>
               <p>I might further argue from the ſpecial reference, that the Token of the Covenant, whether Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Baptiſm, had and has to the remiſſion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin. Circumciſion is ſaid to be a Seal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, which at leaſt includes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin. Saith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to theſe awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Jews, Be baptized for the remiſſion of ſin,</hi> Acts 2. <hi>Ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins,</hi> ſays <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 22.16. Now the Token of the Covenant having ſuch a particular and ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the pardon and remiſſion of ſin, it may (ſuppoſe it will not demonſtrate it it ſelf, yet) much confirm us in this truth, that the Infant-ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are freed from the guilt and condemning power
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106622:66"/>of that ſin they are guilty of, and have that (if not directly, yet) conſequently ſealed and confirmed to them by the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them. And that the Infant-ſeed of Believers have this Good or Benefit, <hi>viz.</hi> Immunity from the condemning power of Original ſin, ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them by the Token of the Covenant, is not only according to the judgments of the generality, if not univerſality of all the Ancients, but of many of our Modern Divines, as the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the Divines of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> with many others, is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, that to produce particular teſtimonies is wholly needleſs.</p>

Friſt, What Promiſes appertain to the Seed of Believers as ſuch. Theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be only two. Firſt, That God will be a God to them. Secondly, That they ſhall be ſaved. The ſecond Queſtion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> What is the Good contained in theſe Promiſes. The Good contained in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more briefly ſhewed. The Good contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former, more largely inſiſted upon. A twofold Good determined to be contained in it. Firſt, A Covenant-relation is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by it between God and the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Secondly, God by it has put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under an obligation to communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to, and act for their Good and Benefit. Thoſe communications of himſelf to, and theſe actings for their Good and Benefit that God has obliged himſelf to, ſhewed to be limited three ways. Where it is ſhewed, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God's being a God to his People, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infants or Adult, does not, as taken abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and by it ſelf, either for the preſent

This proved more generally by one Argument. That confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſeveral branches of it.</head>
               <p n="2">2. AS the Covenant as abſtractly conſidered, and conſequentially their Covenant-ſtate, with a full diſcharge and freedom from the guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of Original ſin, as the Inſeparable and neceſſary effect and conſequence thereof, is rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſealed and confirmed to the Infant-ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them: So the particular Promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant appertaining to them. are alike ſealed and confirmed to them thereby. Now here two things muſt be enquired into.</p>
               <p>Firſt, What Promiſes of the Covenant do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What is the proper good contained in, and anſwerably conferred upon, or aſſured to them by thoſe Promiſes.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I find only theſe two Promiſes made unto them, merely as the Seed of ſuch Parents: There are it's true, other Promiſes that have an indefinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto them, nigher unto which they ſtand than the reſt of Mankind, as has been before obſerved: but for Promiſes made definitely to them, and which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106622:68"/>do appertain unto them, merely as the Seed of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Parents; ſo I conceive there are only theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God will be a God to them. Thus when the Lord firſt eſtabliſhed his Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, he not only promiſes to be a God to him, but to his Seed after him; <hi>I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations, for an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, to be a God to thee and to thy Seed after thee,</hi> Gen. 17.7. So that this Promiſe of God's being a God to them is as expreſsly made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed (and that he intends his natural See, immediately proceeding from his own loins, as well as his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, has been ſufficiently proved elſewhere) as to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; and is ſo continued to all Believers and their natural Seed, as has been alſo proved. So that that is the firſt Promiſe of the Covenant apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Infant-ſeed of Believers as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other is, that God will give them <hi>the Land of</hi> Canaan; that is, as that Promiſe is explained in the New Teſtament, <hi>they ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type of heaven, and the main and principal good intended in that Promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> was Heaven: And hence it was that <hi>Abraham</hi> from this Promiſe raiſes his hope and expectation of <hi>a City that has foundations, whoſe Maker and Builder is God,</hi> Hebr. 11.10. And did not the Promiſe principally intend Heaven, or ſuture Salvation, it had ſignified nothing either to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, or any of his Seed, for upward of four hundred years; beſides 'tis ſaid to be given <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion,</hi> which in reſpect of that Land literally taken was not true. And hence again, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly intimates, or rather expreſsly declares, that all Believers are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106622:68"/>Heirs to, and have an equal intereſt in that Promiſe with <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. to the end of the Chapter, compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.16, 17. He tells us the reaſon of Gods confirming this Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> (having reſpect to this very Promiſe) with an oath was, <hi>that we</hi> (that betake our ſelves to this hope that is ſet before us; that is, do renounce the World, and the things thereof, and betake our ſelves to Chriſt and his ways in hope of Heaven) <hi>might have more ſtrong conſolation:</hi> Now unleſs we were Joynt-heirs with <hi>Abraham</hi> of this Promiſe, the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to him by an oath had made nothing to our conſolation: And this will yet be more evident if we conſider, that as God promiſed <hi>to bleſs</hi> Abraham, <hi>ſo to multiply his Seed, and give them to poſſeſs the gates of their enemies;</hi> that is, he would give them the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and Believers are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and as ſuch Heirs with him of that Promiſe: and hence in confirming that Promiſe unto him with an oath, he alike confirmed it unto us. From all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true mind and meaning of God in it, a promiſe of Heaven: So that I ſay, that is the other Promiſe appertaining to the Seed of Believers as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of future Salvation. Hence the Apoſtle tells the Jaylor, that upon his believing both himſelf and his <hi>houſe ſhould be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16.31. But that is the firſt thing to be enquired into, <hi>viz.</hi> What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant appertain to the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as ſuch? They are theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God will be a God to them, and they ſhall poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> or, as <hi>Abraham</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it, a City that has foundations, whoſe Maker
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106622:69"/>and Builder is God; that is, Heaven; which in other words, is, they ſhall be ſaved. The former of theſe Promiſes reſpects the time preſent; the latter the time to come: for the preſent God will be a God to them; for the future they ſhall be ſaved: that is, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their performance of the conditions of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is the Good intended in, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conveyed and made over to the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by theſe Promiſes?</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the latter of theſe Promiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> that of future Salvation. To begin with that firſt, becauſe there is no difficulty in it (as to what concerns our preſent purpoſe) requiring a large diſcuſſion of it: and therefore in brief, by Salvation we are to underſtand, all that Glory, Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs, whether conſiſting in liberation and freedom from evil, or any poſitive Good, that God has purpoſed, and Chriſt has purchaſed for his People, to be poſſeſſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by them in Heaven, or in the life to come; which though we may rationally ſuppoſe will gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ as injoyed by Infants from that to be poſſeſſed and injoyed by Adult Believers; eſpecially who have attained to higher degrees in Grace and Holineſs; or have done, and ſuffered much for Chriſt here in the World: yet as it will be the ſame for kind, ſo it will be exceeding great. Though the Glory, Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs of the Saved, as well as the Miſery of the Damned will differ gradually, yet the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Glory, Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs to be injoyed in Heaven, as alſo of Miſery to be ſuffered in Hell will be unconceiveably great. The Holy Ghoſt tells us, <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things that God has prepared
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106622:69"/>for them that love him;</hi> that is, for all them that love him. In what latitude we are to underſtand theſe things, ſaid to be prepared for them that love God, we need not enquire: be ſure 'tis true of the things prepared and reſerved for Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they are things that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have they entred into heart of man, not into the heart of a merely natural man, ſo as to conceive what, much leſs how great they are: but not into the heart of ſpiritual or regenerate men ſo as fully to apprehend what or how great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent they are. And as this is true of things that God has prepared for them that love him: So it is alike true of the things prepared for them that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of him, though through the immaturity of their age they are incapable of an actual love to him. The Glory, Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs of the loweſt Saint in Heaven, whether dying in Infancy, or living to years of Maturity, will quite ſurpaſs the preſent thoughts and apprehenſions of the moſt enlightned underſtanding. And I ſay, all that Glory, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bleſſedneſs, is included and intended in this term Salvation, <hi>they ſhall be ſaved,</hi> that is, perfectly freed and delivered from all miſery that man through ſin is become ſubject to; and inſtated in the contrary ſtate of Glory, Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the other Promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That of God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a God to them; there is more difficulty in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining what is that Good contained in, and granted to the Infant-ſeed of Believers by it: In the general this ſeems plain, that it muſt be interpreted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as appertaining to Infants, as it is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and underſtood as appertaining to the Adult, ſeing we have no warrant from the Scripture, neither
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106622:70"/>does the different capacity of Infants and the Adult neceſſitate us to interpret and underſtand it otherwiſe as appertaining to the one, than we do as appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the other: and therefore we muſt a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, and endeavour to ſtate the true ſenſe and meaning of this grand Promiſe of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God promiſes to be a God to his People, whether as appertaining to Infants or Adult Believers; and thus taking the Covenant in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe, for a mutual engagement between God and Man, ſo I conceive only theſe two things are intended, and included in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A mutual Relation between God and his People is conſtituted and eſtabliſhed thereby: and as by the conſtitution of this Relation between God and his People, they are brought nigh to him, and he is nigh to them. Hence they are ſaid to be near to God, <hi>He alſo exalteth the Horn of his People, the praiſe of all his Saints, even of the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>a People near unto him,</hi> Pſal. 148.14. And if they are near to him, he muſt needs be nigh to them: ſo they have a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual propriety and intereſt each in other. Hence are thoſe appropriating terms in Scripture, and that on both parts. Hence on God's part, ſays he, <hi>yea I ſware unto thee, and entred into a Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine,</hi> Ezek. 16.8. Though God has a propriety in all Creatures, they are all his: yet we ſee he lays a peculiar claim to his People, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more eſpecial intereſt and propriety in them above what he has in others, and that by vertue of the Covenant entred with them: So on the People of Gods part, <hi>My Beloved is mine,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Oh my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my Lord,</hi> Pſal. 16.2. And the like appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106622:70"/>terms we have frequently in Scripture. Man by his ſin has loſt his propriety and intereſt in God; hence whoſoever now has an intereſt and propriety in him, it muſt be by vertue of his own free Gift and Promiſe: they only can groundedly lay claim to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and propriety in him to whom he promiſes to be a God. Hence his People hold their intereſt in him, not by vertue of their relation to him as his Creatures, but by the Covenant entred with them, wherein he has promiſed to be a God to them, and take them to be his People. And that is the firſt good contained in, and conveyed to the Infant-ſeed of Believers by this Promiſes, there is a mutual relation conſtituted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by between God and them: by means whereof they have a mutual intereſt and propriety each in other, as they are God's, and therefore ſaid to be <hi>born to him, and to be his Children,</hi> Ezek. 16.20, 21. ſo he is theirs: and how great a Good is that for God to give himſelf to the Seed of his People, as well as to them themſelves? That the great God <hi>quantus, quantus eſt,</hi> is and may be ſaid to be in a proper ſenſe, their God, their Portion and Inheritance?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Good of, or contained in this Promiſe, is this; that God thereby has put himſelf under an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to his People to communicate himſelf to them, and act for their good, benefit and advantage, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own infinite Perfections, the true tenour of the Covenant made with them, and their capacity to receive: or thus, he has by this Promiſe put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under an obligation to his People, to improve and imploy all his Attributes for their good, benefit and advantage, in a way agreeable to the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and their capability of receiving any good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage by that improvement, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106622:71"/>of his ſeveral Attributes for them. So that the communications that God by this Promiſe has obliged himſelf to make of himſelf to his People, and theſe actings for their good, benefic and advantage, that he by the ſame Promiſe has obliged himſelf to, are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By his own infinite Perfections: and thus it is impoſſible for him to communicate his Deity to them, as the Deity of the Father is communicated to the Son; and the Deity of the Father and the Son to the Spirit; the infinity of the Deity renders it incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to any being <hi>extraſe,</hi> without it ſelf: but for his actings for the Good, Benefit and Advantage of his People they receive no limitations from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as abſolutely conſidered in themſelves; becauſe they are all infinite in themſelves, and ſhould he act <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> no other bounds or limits are aſſignable to them by the Creature than their <hi>non Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The communications of God to, and his actings for the Good, Benefit and Advantage of his People, are limited by the Covenanant he has made with them; and that both in regard of the Good he will communicate to, or do for them, and alſo in regard of the terms and conditions upon which he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that Good to, and do it for them. Hence no more good can be expected from God, than what is contained in ſome Promiſe of the Govenant as made either indefinitely with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in general, or definitely with particular and individual perſons; though 'tis true, the full Good contained in ſome Promiſes, eſpecially thoſe relating to the life to come, cannot be comprehended by any, while in this life: and therefore it is ſaid, Chriſt <hi>ſhall come to be admired
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106622:71"/>in them that believe,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.10. the Good they then receive from him, exceeding their preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations: but yet whatever Good they do, or then ſhall receive, is contained in ſome Promiſe. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is <hi>norma judicii,</hi> both in reſpect of rewarding the Righteous and puniſhing the Wicked. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the communications God makes of himſelf to, and his acting for the Good, Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his People, are limited by the Covenant, in regard of the Good communicated to, and done for them: So in regard of the terms and conditions upon which he does, and will communicate himſelf to them, and act for their Good, Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that the Covenant of Grace as definitely made with particular Perſons is conditional, or does require ſomewhat of duty on mans part in order to the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Good promiſed, is to me paſt all rational doubt, and generally granted on all hands. I ſhall not therefore add any thing to prove it, but though God in ſome caſes may, and ſometimes does give the Good of ſome Promiſe, where man either wholly or in a great meaſure fails in performing the conditious prefixed to them; yet he is not obliged either by this grand Promiſe nor any other ſo to do: and in reſpect of the great ſundamental Bleſſings of the Covenant, as pardon of Sin, ſuture Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He never gives them but upon ſuppoſition of the real and true performance of the conditions required in the Covenant on mans part. Hence I conceive it will neceſſarily follow, that as no particular perſons whether Infants or Adult, have ana actual intereſt in this Promiſe; but ſuch as either for or by whom the fundamental conditions required to a Covenant-ſtate are performed: ſo this Promiſe not ſpecifying any particular Good, it does
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106622:72"/>not ſimply and abſolutely of it ſelf confer or give an immediate right to any Good contained in any of the Promiſes of the Covenant to thoſe that have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in it; it only conſtitutes a Covenant-relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, and thereby gives them a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſt and propriety in each other, and then obliges God to communicate himſelf to, and act for the Good, Benefit and Advantage of thoſe that are under it, or intereſted in it, according to the tenour of the whole Covenant, or the various Promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein: ſo that though this Promiſe does virtually include and comprehend the whole Good of the Covenant whether conſiſting in Spiritual or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings, yet does not merely or abſolutely of it ſelf confer, or enſure the Good of any one Promiſe appertaining to the Covenant upon or to any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual or particular Perſons whatſoever; it ſecures the injoyment of all the Good contained in the ſeveral and various Promiſes of the Covenant to thoſe, for or by whom the conditions or duties required therein are performed; but does not abſolutely confer or enſure the injoyment of the Good contained in any one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. And hence, with ſubmiſſion to better judgments, I conceive, that the Covenant-ſtate of the Imfant-ſeed of Believers does not indiſpenſibly require any opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit upon their hearts either for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to act, or facilitating their acting of Grace, as they become capable to do it; or for the renovation of their natures, and effecting Grace in them. No ſuch operations are neceſſary in order to their having or performing the conditions of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſtate; ſeing the condition of their Covenant-ſtate is without them, and is their Parents Faith; no ſuch operations are included in, or aſſured by this Promiſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106622:72"/>of God's being a God to them; nor as I conceive, in that other concerning their future Salvation: for though 'tis true, Regeneration is abſolutely neceſſary to admiſſion into, and the actual poſſeſſion of Heaven; yet that may be wrought <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> (as the relicks of indwelling ſin are purged away in Believers) or at any time anteceding when God ſees meet: But of this more by and by.</p>
               <p>And that this Promiſe of God's being a God to his People, whether Infants or Adult Believers, does not of it ſelf either immediately confer, or for the future abſolutely enſure the Good contained in any of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Promiſes of the Covenant made to them, and conſequently only lays ſuch an obligation upon God as is afore expreſt, I ſhall firſt prove by one more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Argument, and then clear it up in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> Whatever Good is either conferred or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the preſent, or enſured for the future, by any Promiſe as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly held forth, or neceſſarily implyed in the Terms in which it is made, or elſe muſt in ſome other place of Scripture be declared to be intended in it: But in this Promiſe no particular Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, the enumeration being full and ſufficient, that cannot be gainſaid.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>minor,</hi> the truth of that will appear in the particular Branches of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That no particular Good contained in any of the Promiſes of the Covenant is expreſsly held forth in the Terms of this Promiſe it ſelf, is obvious unto all: God's promiſing to be a God to any nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecifies, nor particularly expreſſes any particular Good he will vouchſafe to, or beſtow upon them:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106622:73"/>it is only a more general aſſurance of ſome Good, but what that Good is, or upon what terms it ſhall be injoyed is not expreſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no particular Good is neceſſarily implyed or included in the Terms of the Promiſe is evident thus. It muſt be implyed and included either merely <hi>ſub notione boni,</hi> or <hi>ſub notione boni promiſſi,</hi> either as a Good in the general, or as a promiſed Good: but no particular Good can be implyed or included under either of theſe notions; for then all Good in general, at leaſt all promiſed Good, muſt be implyed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>à quatenùs ad omne valet conſequentia,</hi> and then all Good, at leaſt all promiſed Good, would be either actually conferred, or a right thereunto would be given, or the future injoyment thereof would be infallibly ſecured upon or to all thoſe that have an Intereſt in this Promiſe; the contrary whereunto is not only evident to every ones obſervation, but unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably evident from Scripture, as ſhall be ſhewed more fully by and by.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That any particular Good contained in any of the Promiſes of the Covenant is declared in any Scripture to be implyed or included in this Promiſe cannot be affirmed; becauſe no ſuch Declaration is to be ſound. Whatever Scriptures may be produced for that purpoſe, I doubt not, but it will be eaſily made to appear they prove not the thing they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for the proof of. Hence I conclude, that this Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, does neither actually confer, nor give a right to, nor abſolutely ſecure any particular Good contained in any of the Promiſes of the Covenant upon or to thoſe that have an Intereſt in it: but is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106622:73"/>only an obligation upon God to communicate himſelf to them, and act or improve and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his ſeveral Attributes for their Good, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Advantage, according to the true tenour of the Covenant and the various Promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That the foremenioned Good, and that only, is contained in that grand Promiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, further confirmed in ſome particular Inſtances. The firſt Inſtance propoſed. No ſpecial or ſaving influences or operations of the Spirit are included in this Promiſe, ſo as by it, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon, or abſolutely enſured to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in it.

A ſecond Inſtance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: where it is proved, That no Love that is peculiar and proper to the Elect, is expreſt or enſured in or by this grand Promiſe of the Covenant, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, to all interested in it. This largly inſisted upon. What may be pleaded against it, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106622:74"/>A brief Recapitulation of that Good redounding to the Seed of Believers, as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Covenant with their Parents, and having theſe two Promiſes appertaining to them. That Good ſummed up under four Heads. That the Seed of Believers have all Good, proved by four Arguments. The ſecond Queſtion for the unfolding this ſecond Good or Benefit ariſing to the Seed of Believers from the Application of the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, propoſed: where it is ſhewed wherein the Benefit and Advantage of having the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Promiſe of it ratified, ſealed and confirmed by an outward Sign or Token, does conſist. What hazard is run by the neglect of the Application of the Token of the Covenant, ſhewed.</head>
               <p>FOr the further clearing up and confirming of what is affirmed, I ſhall inſtance in ſome particular Good things promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, which of all things promiſed may ſeem moſt probably included in, and conſequently granted and enſured by this Promiſe to thoſe that have an intereſt in it, and ſhew that they are not ſo included in it, as by it, as abſolutely taken, to be conferred upon, granted or enſured to any that are intereſted in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Let us inſtance in the ſpecial and ſaving ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and influences of the Spirit of God. Theſe are a Good which of all Good things promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may ſeem to be moſt eſſential to this Promiſe, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106622:74"/>yet we ſhall find it to be otherwiſe. And for clearing up of this we may obſerve, that theſe ſaving influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and operations of the Spirit are vouchſafed for a threefold end and purpoſe in the general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, For the effecting and producing the firſt Grace, as the firſt ſaving Illumination of the Mind, the Renovation of the Nature by Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, For the maintaining the Seed and truth of Grace in the Soul, whereby its Union with Chriſt is continued.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, For the managing and carrying on the further ſpiritual concerns of the Soul, conſiſting in higher degrees of Sanctification, Aſſurance, Peace, Joy, the due performance of holy Duties and the like. Now that theſe ſaving influences and operations of the Spirit for any of, or for all theſe ſeveral ends and purpoſes are not ſo included in this Promiſe of God's being 2 God to his People, as to be actually granted or enſured by it, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, to any of thoſe that have an Intereſt in it, will appear two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, more generally, and we may argue thus: If any of theſe ſaving influences and operations of the Spirit are included in, and abſolutely enſured by this Promiſe, as taken abſolutly and by it ſelf; then they are all alike included in, and abſolutely enſured by it: But all theſe influences and operations of the Spirit are not included in, or abſolutely enſured by it; and therefore not any.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is undeniable: for if all theſe ſaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and operations of the Spirit are included in, and abſolutely enſured by this Promiſe, as taken abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and by it ſelf, then all that have an intereſt in the Promiſe would injoy all thoſe influences and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit, and that in the higheſt degree, or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106622:75"/>elſe God muſt be ſuppoſed to fail in the performance of the Promiſe: but now it is paſt all rational contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that all that have an Intereſt in this Promiſe, do not injoy all theſe influences and operations of the Spirit, poſſibly ſome, if not all, yet in a very low degree, and then much leſs in the higheſtdegree; neither can it without blaſphemy be ſuppoſed that God does at any time fail in the performance of his Promiſes: therefore undoubtedly they are not all, eſpecially in the higheſt degree, in which they may be injoyed by men in this life, included in, nor abſolutely enſured by this Promiſe.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition is evident; becauſe the Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, neither ſpecifieth nor particularizeth any of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences or operations of the Spirit, neither is there any thing in the Promiſe it ſelf, nor in any explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or interpretation that God himſelf in any other place of Scripture makes of it, is a ground for us to diſtinguiſh and ſay, ſuch influences and operations of the Spirit are included in, and abſolutely enſured by it, and not others; and where neither the Promiſe it ſelf diſtinguiſheth, nor are we in any other place of Scripture warranted to diſtinguiſh of the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in, and enſured by the Promiſe, there we are not at all to diſtinguiſh; and hence, as in caſe any of theſe influences and operations of the Spirit are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in, and abſolutely enſured by this Promiſe, we have no reaſon from the Promiſe it ſelf, why we ſhould not conclude that they are all included in, and enſured by it: ſo ſeeing it is certain they are not all included in, and enſured by it, we have no reaſon to conclude nor ſuppoſe that any are. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, more particularly: And thus we ſhall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106622:75"/>find this true in reſpect of theſe influences and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, as vouchſafed for theſe ſeveral ends and purpoſes before mentioned, diſtinctly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For thoſe influences and operations of the Spirit vouchſafed for the effecting and producing the firſt Grace; that theſe influences and operations of the Spirit cannot be included in, or enſured by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is evident; Becauſe in reſpect of the Adult they are indiſpenſibly preſuppoſed to an Intereſt in it, and the Promiſe cannot ſecure to any a Good that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly required antecedent to an Intereſt in it; for then it would ſecure the Good contained in it to theſe to whom at preſent it does not appertain, which is impoſſible; for then a Man muſt be ſuppoſed to have an Intereſt in the Promiſe before he has that which is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to his having an Intereſt in it, which is an abſolute contradiction. Now if this Promiſe does not ſecure theſe influences and operations of the Spirit to ſuch, it cannot be rationally ſuppoſed to ſecure them to any others, and conſequently they cannot be included in, or enſured to any by it, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For thoſe influences of the Sppirit vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, for the maintaining the ſeed and truth of Grace in the Soul wherein it is already wrought, whereby its Union with Chriſt is maintained: that thoſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and operations of the Spirit are not included in, nor enſured by this Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, is alike evident with the former, and that upon the ſame ground, <hi>viz.</hi> the neceſſary precedency of the Soul's union with Chriſt, and conſequently of theſe influences and operations of the Spirit nèceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the maintaining of that union, at leaſt in order
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106622:76"/>of nature to its holding its intereſt in the Promiſe; <hi>If that which ye have heard from the beginning ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father,</hi> 1 John 2.24. The remaining or abiding of the Word, <hi>viz.</hi> in that effect or fruit of it, habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace in the Soul, is the condition of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt neceſſarily be conſidered as antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to (at leaſt in order of nature) its union with and intereſt in both the Son and the Father. Hence ſhould theſe influences and operatious of the Spirit be included in, and enſured by this Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, it would ceaſe to be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and become an abſolute Promiſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſcharge the People of God from all duty ſubordinate to their maintaining their Union with Chriſt and intereſt in this Promiſe: to talk of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe which requires duty on Man's part in order to his injoying the Good contained in it, is an abſolute contradiction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, For the third Head of the Spirit's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and operations, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are vouchſaſed for the carrying on and managing the further and higher concerns of the Soul, in the various degrees of Sanctification, Aſſurance, Peace, Joy, ſpiritual performance of holy duties and the like, that theſe are not included in this grand Promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſo as to be conſerred, or abſolutely enſured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as taken abſoultely and by it ſelf, to all that have an intereſt in it, is evident from the undenyable experiences of many, if not moſt Believers. 'Tis poſſible that true Believers may for a time be ſo far deſerted, as to injoy only ſuch influences and operations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as are ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106622:76"/>the life of Grace in them, and that in the very habit and ſeed thereof, which could not be, in caſe theſe influences and operations of the Spirit vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed for theſe higher ends and purpoſes were included in, and abſolutely ſecured by this Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf: ſo that the truth affirmed is ſufficiently evident in this firſt inſtance. None of the ſaving influences or operations of the Spirit are included in this Promiſe of God's being a God to his People, ſo as by it as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, to be conſerred upon, or abſolutely enſured to any intereſted in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But poſſibly ſome may object, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſeems to be called the <hi>Promiſe of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 3.14. And therefore, ſure it muſt neceſſarily include at leaſt ſome of the ſaving influences and operations of the Spirit, and conſequently ſecure them to all that have an intereſt in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That any of the ſaving operations of the Spirit are included in this Promiſe cannot be concluded from that Scripture, will appear by a brief view of the ſeveral interpretations that it will admit of, and are put upon it by our beſt Interpreters. Thus ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that a diſtinct Good is intended in this Promiſe of the Spirit, from that bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaid to come upon the Gentiles through Chriſt. By the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> we are to underſtand the Good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this grand Promiſe of the Covenant, <hi>viz. That God would be a God to him and his Seed;</hi> but then by the Promiſe of the Spirit, they conceive a further conſequential Good is intended, <hi>viz.</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling preſence of the Spirit, with thoſe ſaving influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and operations that are conſequential there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Chryſoſtom.</note>.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106622:77"/>And for the right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this, we muſt obſerve, that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks to Adult Believers, and tells them that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> was come upon them, through Chriſt they were made Heirs of this Promiſe, as the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> they were now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Promiſe of God's being a God to them and their natural Seed, as he was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as conſequential to their intereſt in this Promiſe they were under another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Spirit: So that the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of the Promiſe of the Spirit as appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Adult Believers conſequential to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bleſſing being come upon them. Of this Opinion were <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> of old, and <hi>Beza</hi> of late; but others ſuppoſe that one and the ſame Good is intended in both parts of the Verſe, and anſwerably that by the Promiſe of the Spirit is meant the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to be come upon the Gentiles. And taking the words thus, a twofold ſenſe may be given of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> may be called the Promiſe of the Spirit, only to denote the nature or kind of that bleſſing promiſed, 'tis a ſpiritual Bleſſing, or a Promiſe of a ſpiritual Good, ſo <hi>Pareus;</hi> or elſe that Bleſſing may be called the Promiſe of the Spirit, only to denote the Author of it, it was given by the Spirit, and by his Inſpiration left upon Record in the Scriptures: ſo that take the ſenſe which way we will, there is no neceſſity that we ſhould take that Promiſe including a Promiſe of the Spirit. But let that ſuffice for the firſt inſtance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us take another inſtance in the Love
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106622:77"/>and Favour of God, that is a peculiar Good promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>I will love them freely,</hi> Hoſ. 14.4. Now here again we ſhall find that this Promiſe taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily imply or include, and conſequently does not abſolutely enſure to all that have an intereſt in it, ſuch Love or Favour from God as is peculiar and proper to the Elect: The Aplſtle <hi>John</hi> indeed tells us, <hi>that God is Love,</hi> and as he is eſſentially Love, ſo he expreſſes his Love, as in various ways, ſo in various degrees and meaſures towards his Creatures, according to the good pleaſure of his Will: Now it is readily granted, that God does expreſs more Love, or does vouchſafe higher and greater effects and fruits of his Love to thoſe to whom he has extended his Covenant, or between himſelf and whom he hath conſtituted a Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation. than he has done to the reſt of Mankind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and whom there is no ſuch Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation. Thus the very extending his Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and giving them a preſent propriety in, and taking them to be a peculiar People to himſelf, are glorious expreſſions or fruits of his Love to them; beſides various other expreſſions and fruits of his Love vouchſaſed to them as in a Covernant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and Members of the Church and Family of Chriſt as viſible here upon earth, and while the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-relation, with the priviledges attending it are continued to them, the Love expreſt in it and them is continued to them: But yet, as theſe expreſſions and fruits of his Love and Favour are not peculiar and proper to the Elect, but may be common to others with them, and may be, and anſwerably are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from them. upon a failure in the performance of the conditions of the Covenant by them; ſo no
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106622:78"/>more or no further Love is enſured by this Promiſe, than what is actually expreſſed in giving it to them, and conſtituting thereby a Covenat-relation between him and them, and vouchſafing them the Token of his Covenant, and thereby admiſſion into his Church, Kingdom and Family as viſible here upon earth. So that I have here two things to prove.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, That God may extend his Covenant to the Non-elect, ſo as to conſtiture thereby a true Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation between himſelf and them, and may thereupon vouchſafe them tjhe Token of his Covenant, and thereby admiſſion into the viſible Church, and conſequently that what Love and Favour is expreſt in theſe things is no peculiar to the Elect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, That this grand Promiſe of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily include, and conſepuently does not enſure any further Love or Favour peculiar and proper to the Elect to any of thoſe to whom it is made, and to whom it does appertain.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, that is proved thus: If for God ſo to extend his Covenant to, or enter it with ſome Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elect, as to conſtitute a true and proper Covenant-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between himſelf and them, and to vouchſafe them thereupon the Token of it, and thereby admit them as Members of the Church viſible, be ſimply and abſolutely poſſible in it ſelf, and be no way inconſiſtent with what himſelf has revealed and declared in his Word, wither concerning the ſubjects or nature and tenour of the Covenant, or concerning the Good vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, or to be vouchſafed to thoſe who are taken in as ſubjects of it, then he may extend it in the ſenſe before expreſt to ſome Non-elect, and anſwerably vouchſafe them the Token of it: But the former is true; therefore
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106622:78"/>the Latter. The <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition alone needs proof: and here we have in the general two things to prove.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That for God to extend his Covenant to the Non-elect and vouchſafe them the Token of it, is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely poſſible in it ſelf; Now for this, that this is ſimply and abſolutely poſſible is unqueſtionable. The Soveraignty of God and his abſolute freedom to deal with his Creatures as himſelf pleaſes, ſecures this paſt all rational doubt; if he may (as who queſtions but that he may) enter Covenant conditionally with all Men, why may he not go ſomewhat further with ſome, and actually take them into a Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with himſelf, and vouchſafe them the Token of his Covenant whom yet he has not-ordained to Salvation?</p>
               <p>Secondly, That for God thus to do is no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with what he has revealed and declared in his Word, either concerning the ſubjects or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and tenour of the Covenant, or concerning the Good vouchſafed, or to be vouchſafed to thoſe that are taken in as the ſubjects of it. The truth of this will appear in the particular branches: And thus,</p>
               <p>Firſt, For God to extend his Covenant to ſome Non-elect, and anſwerably vouchſafe them the Token of it, is no way inconſiſtent with what he has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Word concerning the ſubjects of it: This is ſufficiently wvident, becauſe whatever God has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Word concerning the ſubjects of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, yet he has no where declared that he would not take in any as the ſubjects of it that were not elected; he has no where limited his Covenant to the Elect. If there be any ſuch declaration in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures let it be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That for God ſo to extend his Covenant
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106622:79"/>to ſome Non-elect, is no way inconfiſtent with what he has declared in his Word concerning the nature and tenour of the Covenant it ſelf. That which alone can be pleaded, as oppoſing God's extending his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the ſenſe expreſt to the Non-elect, is, what he has declared concerning the everlaſtingneſs and unchangeableneſs of it, with the proviſion made, and ſecurity given, that it ſhall never be broken by thoſe that are taken in as ſubjects of it; And there is indeed a ſeeming inconſiſtency between what is now affirmed concerning Gods extending his Covenant to the Non-elect, and thoſe things ſo frequently aſſerted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in the Scriptures; and thus much ſhall be readily granted, that thoſe things ſo frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleared and repeated in the Scriptures concerning the Covenant, do infallibly prove that the Covenant as entred with ſome, ſhall ſtand firm and remain invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, ſhall never be broken; yet I coneive all that is delcared in Scripture of this nature concerning the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, will not prove but that God may, and that in a conſiſtency with his Word, extend it in the ſenſe expreſt to ſome that are not elected. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, As for what the Scriptures declare concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the everlaſtingneſs of the Covenant: And thus it's true, the Covenant of Grace is frequently affirmed to be an everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. But to that I would ſay three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Covenant may be called an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant on either of theſe two accounts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, On the account of the Good promiſed in it: The Good promiſed in the Covenant is not a mere temporal, or temporary Good, but an eternal or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Good, even everlaſting bleſſedneſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Thus the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is ſaid to be an
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106622:79"/>everlaſting Poſſeſſion, becauſe the Good typified by, and principally intended in the Promiſe of that Land, is everlaſting Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs: Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Covenant may be ſaid to be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, on the account of the duration of it throughout all ages, and that as to the eſſence or ſubſtance of it invariable, whether we reſpect the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes on God's part, or the duties to be performed on Man's part: though there has been, and may be ſome variations in the adminiſtrations of the Covenant, yet it is as to the ſubſtance of it one and the ſame, and ſo ſhall continue while <hi>Abraham</hi> has a Seed upon the earth; and on either of theſe accounts it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an everlaſting Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be ſome will ſay, if we grant that the Covenant is not called an everlaſting Covenant from the conſtancy and immutability of it as made with particulare Perſons, the foundation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perſeverance will be greatly ſhaken thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I ſhall only ſay two or three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That its true we muſt have an equal reſpect unto all the Doctrines of the Goſpel, eſpecially that are of equal weight and importance: and anſwerably take heed that we do not eſtabliſh one Doctrine upon the ruines of another; that we do not by end eavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſtabliſh one Doctrine ſhake the foundations of another; and hence as we muſt be careful, that, while we end eavour to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of Infant-Baptiſm, we do not ſhake the Doctrine of Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſo <hi>vice verſa;</hi> both Doctrines may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently eſtabliſhed upon Scripture grounds without prejudice each to other: And therefore</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though we grant the Scriptures affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant to be an everlaſting Covenant, will
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106622:80"/>not infallibly prove its conſtancy and immutability, as made with particulare perſons, yet the Doctrine of Saints perſeverance may be eſtabliſhed againſt all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional oppoſition upon other Scripture grounds: Of which more hereafter; and therefore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may grant, yea affirm, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is ſaid to be everlaſting from its conſtancy and immutability, as made with particulare perſons, and yet hold and maintain that God may extend it in the ſenſe expreſt to ſome that are not elected, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably an Argument may be drawn from this property of the Covenant,<note place="margin">See my <hi>Infant-Baptiſm from Heaven.</hi> Book 1. Page 50.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> its Eternity, for the eſtabliſhing the Doctrine of Perſeverance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice to the Doctrine of Inſant-Baptiſm; only then we muſt dinſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant as compleatly made with the Adult, and as leſs compleatly entred with Infants as the Seed of believing Parents. And that when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is called an everlaſting Covenant, it's to be underſtood of the Covenant as compleatly made with the Adult, is evident from the way it comes to be ſo; and that is by God's putting his Laws in the minds, and writing them in the hearts of thoſe with whom it is made. Now theſe Promiſes of putting the Law in the mind, and writing it in the heart, as they are only made indefinitely to the Church in general, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſecure not the Good contaiued in them to each individual perſon to whom in common with others they do appertain; ſo they are at leaſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily only made good to the Adult, and to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are made good the Covenant abides firm, and as eſtabiſhed between God and them, may be truly called an everlaſting Covenant: But this brings me
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106622:80"/>to the third Branch of this ſecond thing propoſed for proof of the <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition of our foregoing Argument; ſo that what is declared in the Scriptures concerning the everlaſtingneſs of the Covenant, may very well conſiſt with what is affirmed concerning God's extending it to the Non-elect. It may be ſaid to be an everlaſting Covenant on ſeveral accounts, but grant it to be ſo called on the account of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and immutability as made with particular perſons, yet it muſt then be taken as made only with the Adult. God has made his Covenant conditionally with all mankind, whereby though all men as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely conſidered are put in a capacity or poſſiblity of being ſaved, yet Salvation is abſolutely ſecured to none; he has ſo extended his Covenant to the Seed of Believers as thereby to conſtitute a true and proper Covenant-relation between himſelf and them, when yet, the Covenant being not fully compleat, their ſtate is mutable: when the condition devlves upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they may fail in the performance of it, and thereupon be caſt out; but when once the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes compleat, is mutually plighted between God and an Adult perſon, through the ſaving operations of the Spirit upon the heart, now it is an unchangeable and everlaſting Covenant, the ſoul's performance of the conditions being ſecured by the abiding preſence of the Spirit in it. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That for God ſo to extend his Covenant to ſome that are not elected, as to conſtitute a true and proper Covenant-relation between himſelf and them, is no way inconſiſtent with what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declare concerning any Good vouchſafed or to be vouchſafed to thoſe that are taken in as Subjects of it. And here again a twofold Good can only, as I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106622:81"/>judge be pleaded, as oppoſing what is affirmed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Their diſcharge and immunity from the guilt and concemning power of Original ſin, reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from their Covenant-ſtate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Saving Grace. The former is a Good actually vouchſafed; the latter may be ſuppoſed to be neceſſarily vouchſafed, by vertue of the Promiſe made to the Covenant-people of God.</p>
               <p>But for the former, I ſhall only ſay, 'tis ſufficient that God has no where declared in his Word, that all that are or may be diſcharged of, and have an immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the guilt and condemning power of any, however of Original ſin, ſhall infallibly be preſerved in a Covenant-ſtate, and thereby brought to Salvation at laſt. I know in part what is ſaid as to this, but let me ſay, to bottom the Doctrine of Perſeverance upon ſuch a ſuppoſition is altogether unſafe. Whether the guilt of Original ſin do revive and be recharged upon ſuch of the Seed of Believers as do, when they grow up to years of Maturity, neglect to take hold of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and thereby forfeit their intereſt in it, is a queſtion of more difficulty to reſolve, than uſefulneſs when reſolved; and therefore I ſhall paſs it by.</p>
               <p>For the latter Good, which may be ſuppoſed to be neceſſarily vouchſafed to all that are taken in as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaving Grace, I have ſaid ſo much to it once and again, I need add no more at preſent; that may ſuffice that the Promiſes containing that Good, at leaſt as it is meant of the firſt Grace, are not made to any in particular, they are made to the Church in general, and anſwerably ſecure the Good contained in them only to the Elect; and that hinders not but that God may extend his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in the ſenſe intended to ſome that are not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106622:81"/>But let that ſuffice for the firſt thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, does not neceſſarily include or ſecure to all thoſe to whom it is made, or to whom it does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain, any ſurther Love and Favour from God that is peculiar and proper to the Elect: as it does not neveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imply or infer Election, or that all theſe to whom it is made are elected, and conſequently beloved with the Love of Election, ſo it doew not neceſſarily include or ſecureany conſequent Love or Favour that is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and proper to the Elect. This will appear, if we conſider, what Love and Favour is peculiar and proper to the Elect; and that falls under a twofold conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Firſt, As a love of Beneficence. Secondly, As a love of Complacence.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, And thus the Love and Favour of God, as expreſt in a way of Beneficence to the Elect, differs from that common Love and Favour vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to men in general, only in degree, and thoſe fruits and effects wherein it is expreſt; 'tis acted more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely (to ſpeak of God after the manner of men, and according to our ſhallow apprhenſions of him) and in different effects and fruits, than it is acted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed towards men in general; theſe Effects and Fruits, which we are at preſent only concerned in, may in the general be reduced to theſe three Heads, Regeneration to a ſtate of life, Preſervation in that ſtate, and ſuture Glorfication. Now none of theſe Effects and Fruits of the Love and Favour of God are neceſſarily included in, or ſecured by this Promiſe as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, this has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved already: for if the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be not included in, or ſecured by it, neither of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106622:82"/>the two latter can, in as much as they neceſſarity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe the antecedency of this. Now that this firſt Fruit and Effect of that ſpecial Love and Favour of God peculiar and proper to the Elect is not neceſſarity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in, or ſecured by this Promiſe, is ſufficiectly evident from what has been already ſaid, therefore I ſhall add no more.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> The Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God as expreſt in a way of complacency and delight: and under this Head we may comprehend all thoſe things wherein this Love and Favour of God is expreſt, or whereby it is ſignified to thoſe to whom it is vouchſaſed, as the ſignal manifeſtations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Chriſt in his ſmiles upon the Soul, the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings abroad of his Love in the heart, and the like. Now that the Love and Favour of God, as expreſt this way, is not neceſſarily included in, or ſecured by this Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, will neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follow from what has been already ſaid. This Love and Favour of God to Men always ſuppoſes them truly regenerrte and ſanctified, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot be included in, or ſecured by that Promiſe in which Regeneration and Sanctification are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, or by which they are not ſecured; or at leaſt which does not preſuppoſe them already wrought, and is acted and expreſſed according to the degree of Sanctification attained, to the lively exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace, due performance of Obedience and the like. Hence thoſe that are truly regenerated, may ſo ſink and degenerate in their Sanctification, exerciſe of Grace, and performance of Obedience, as that this Love ſhall be acted and expreſſed (if at all, yet) in a very low and remiſs degree; whereas were it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in, and ſecered by this Promiſe, as taken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106622:82"/>and by it ſelf, it would be acted and expreſſed always alike towards all, to whom this Promiſe does appertain: So that to come to a cloſe of this, we may evidently ſee, that as Intereſt in this Promiſe does not univerſally flow from the elevting Love of God, he may make this Promiſe to ſome that are not elected, and thereby conſtitute a true and proper Covenant-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between himſelf &amp; them, and anſwerably vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe them the Token of his Covenant, and by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that to them ſolemnly admit them into his Church viſible; ſo no further or conſequent Love or Favour that is peculiar and proper to the Elect, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily included in, nor ſecured by that Promiſe, and conſequently (which is the thing aſſerted) this Promiſe as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, does not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply, that all to whom it does appertain, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or do injoy any of that Love and Favour that is peculiar and proper to the Elect, neither is that Love and Favour neceſſarily included in, or ſecured by it, to thoſe to whom it does appertain. But that is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inſtance to prove what is afferted, <hi>viz.</hi> That no particular Good contained in any of the Promiſes of the Covenant is either implyed in, or ſecured by this grand Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf to any to whom it does appertain. I had intended to have proceeded ſomewhat furcher, but I am loth to be over tedious, and I conceive what has been ſaid may ſuffice. I ſuppoſe it will be granted, that in caſe neither any of the ſaving influences and operations of the Spirit, nor any of that ſpecial Love and Favour that is peculiar and proper to the Elect, which are two of the moſt eſſential Good things of the Covenant, be imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, or ſecured to any, to whom this Promiſe does appertain by it, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106622:83"/>then no other Good contained in any other Promiſe of the Covenant is implyed or included in, or ſecured by it, as ſo taken: And therefore let that ſuffice for the ſecond way, how the communications of himſelf to, and his actings for the Good, Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Covenant-people, whereunto God has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf by this Promiſe. are limited; they are limited by the tenour of the Covenant, and of the various Promiſes contained therein, and conſequently, no particular Good contained in any of the Promiſes of the Covenant, being neceſſarily implyed or included in, or ſecured by this Promiſe, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf; it will undeniably follow that this Promiſe is only a more general obligation upon God to perform and make good the whole Covenant, yet not abſolutely, but according to the true tenour of it, and of the various Promiſes contained in it: ſo that as none by vertue of this Promiſe can lay claim to any Good, but what is ſomewhere promiſed, ſo none can expect any Good promiſed, but according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of, and terms upon which the Promiſe contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Good is made. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly. There is another way how the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of himſelf to, and his actings for the Good Benefit and Advantage of thoſe this Promiſe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to, whereunto by this Promiſe God has obliged himſelf, are limited, and that is the capacity of the Subject to receive, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>numquodque recipitur ſecundum modum recipientis.</hi> But this being excentrical to my preſent deſign, I ſhall wholly paſs it by. From the whole of what has been hitherto ſaid, as to this ſecond Good or Benefit that the Inſant-ſeed of Believers have by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them, we ſee what the Token of the Covenant, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106622:83"/>to them by reference and relation to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what Promiſes of the Covenant appertain to them, and alſo what is the Good contained in, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently granted to, or ſetled upon them by thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and that was the firſt thing enquired into. Now as a cloſe of this, and before I proceed to the ſecond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, I conceive it is neceſſary that I ſhould reflect a little back, and ſum up and give a diſtinct and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of what Good the Infant-ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have, as received with their Parents into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and as having in particular thoſe Promiſes aforementioned made unto unto them; and alſo add ſomething further to prove that they indeed have all that Good, as ſo received into Covenant, and as having thoſe Promiſes made to them: As for the Good they have, that is fourfold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, They are put into a New-Covenant ſtate, they are abſolutely for the preſent removed from under the Covenant of Works, or the Covenant entred with Man in the ſtate of Innocency, and taken into, as the actual Subjects of, the ſecond Covenant, or Covenant of Grace; that is their preſent ſtate, they are actually under the Covenant of Grace, and as the neceſſary effect and conſequence thereof are freed and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the guilt and condemning power of Original ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They have at preſent true real and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intereſt and propriety in God: as they are his, ſo he is theirs, there is a mutual propriety and intereſt in each other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They have God under an actual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> of his Promiſe to improve and imploy all his Attributes for their Good Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage according, or in a way agreeable to the true te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106622:84"/>of the Covenant and of the various Promiſes of it.</p>
               <p>Fouthly, They have a preſent Interſt in, and Right to Salvation, and anſwerably, in caſe of their death before a ſorfeiture be made of that their Intereſt and Right, they ſhall be infallibly ſaved. This Promiſe of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made to them as the Seed of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, requires nothing on their part to the injoyment of the Good contained in it; and God having ingaged by Promiſe to be a God unto them, he has thereby obliged himſelf to make good this Promiſe to them: Now though upon ſuppoſition that the Covenant and Promiſes thereof appertaining to the Seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers be entred with, and made to them definitely, that is, with and to each one in particular, (which that they are, has been before proved, and is now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for granted) I cannot apprehend how it can with any ſhew of reaſon be denied, but muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be granted, that they have all that Good now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and aſſigned to them; and conſequently any further proof may ſeem to be ſuperfluous; yet <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> I ſhall add theſe three or four Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Firſt what Good is, either according to the literal and moſt proper ſenſe and ſignification of the words, contained in theſe Promiſes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or does neceſſarily and inſeparably ariſe and flow from the very eſtabliſhment of the Covenant with the Infant-ſeed of Believers, that Good they have, as received thereunto with their Parents, and as having thoſe Promiſes made unto them: but all that Good aforementioned either according to the literal or moſt proper ſenſe an ſignification of the words, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Promiſes of the Covenant, or elſe does neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and inſcparably ariſe and flow from the very
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106622:84"/>eſtabliſhment of the Covenant with the Seed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents; therefore they have all that Good as received into the Covenant with their Parents, and as having theſe Promiſes made unto them. Both theſe Propoſitions carry their own evidence with ſo much clearneſs, that I need add nothing for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of either of them. Certainly when God promiſes to be a God to the Seed of his People, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the literal and moſt proper ſenſe and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words, he means himſelf, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret that Promiſe of any lower Good would be to offer apparent violence to it; and the like may be ſaid of the Promiſe of Salvation, and that a New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſtate, Propriety and Intereſt in God, with an obligation upon him to improve all his Attributes for the Good, Benefit and Advantage of thoſe to whom the Promiſe is made, and a Right to Salvation, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ariſe and flow from the very eſtabliſhment of the Covenant, and making theſe Promiſes with, or to any, whether Inſants or Adult, will as I ſuppoſe be queſtioned by none: And therefore</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Secondly, If believing Parents have all that Good as received into Covenant, and as having thoſe Promiſes made unto them; then ſo have their Inſant-ſee, they being alike received into Covenant, and having the ſame Promiſes made alike to them: but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>The antecedent is ſecured from any oppoſition not only by evidence of Scripture light, but by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal acknowledgment of all Chriſtians; neither do I ſee any ground from Scripture, or right Reaſon to doubt of the conſequence: This is undoubred to me, that Poedo-Baptiſts aſſigning one kind of Good to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and another to Inſants, while yet they plead
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106622:85"/>for Inſants having the ſame Intereſt in the Covenant and theſe grand Promiſes of it that Parents have, has not a little promoted the errour of Anti-Poado-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Unleſs the Infant-ſeed of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Parents have that Good afore declared, they have no intereſt at all in the Covenant: but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſeed of believing Parents have a true and real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conſequence in the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition will not be queſtioned by Poedo-Baptiſts, for whoſe ſake I now write as well as for the ſake of Anti-Poedo-Baptiſts: But that is evident thus.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that have no Good, that is of the eſſence and ſubſtance of the Covenant, have no preſent intereſt in the Covenant: but unleſs Infants have that Good aſore declared, they have no Good that is of the eſſence and ſubſtance of the Covenant; <hi>Ergo.</hi> This Argument in the whole of it is ſo obvious to every ordinary underſtanding, at leaſt will ſo evidently appear upon a diligent ſearch, that I ſhall ſurceaſe the proof it, and only add one more Argument, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſecond enquiry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. If the Inſant-ſeed of Believers, as received into Coivenant, and as having thoſe Promiſes made to them, have not the Good afore expreſt, then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant would be no ſecurity to any of them, nor any ground of hope to their Parents as to their future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in cafe of their death in their pure Infant-ſtate, before they have perſonally taken haold of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant themſelves: but the Covenant is ſome ſecurity to the Inſant-ſeed of believing parents, and may be ſome ground of hope to their Parents as to their future happineſs in caſe of their death in their pure Infant-ſtate;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106622:85"/>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi> If the Seed of Believers have neither a diſcharge from the guilt of Original ſin, nor any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety or Intereſt in God, nor Right to Salvation by the Covenant and Promiſes thereof entred with, or made to them; how is it poſſible that either the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or any Promiſe of it ſhould be any ſecurity to them, or any ground of hope to their Parents that they ſhall be ſaved in caſe of death in their pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſtate? and if they have no ſecurity, nor their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents any ground of hope as to their future happineſs from the Covenant, then the Covenant and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes would be wholly inſignificant, and of no uſe or advantage at all either to Parents or Children, in reſpect of all thoſe that die in that ſtate; and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part of the Seed of Believers as well as of others die in that ſtate, is known to all men. But now it ſeems to be altogether unreaſonable to imagine that God ſhould extend his Covenant to the Seed of his People, and ſeal it by an outward Sign or Token, and yet neither the Covenant nor any one Promiſe of it be of any uſe or advantage at all, either to Parents or Children in reſpect of ſo great a part of their Seed. From all I conceive it will undeniably follow, that the Infant-ſeed of Believers and that univerſally have, as received into Covenant, and having theſe two grand Promiſes of it in ſpecial made unto them as the Seed of ſuch Parents, the whole Good afore declared: as for their ſtate, they are actually under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and have and abſolute diſcharge from the guilt of Original ſin; as the inſeparable effect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof, they have a preſent actual propriety in God; he is their God, and as ſuch under an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to make good unto them the whole Covenant according to the true tenour of it, they have a preſent
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106622:86"/>Right to future Salvation, and anſwerably under an infallible certainty of injoying it, ſuppoſing their non-forſeiture of that their Right, which during their pure Infant-ſtate they are incapable to do. But to proceed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Wherein does the Good of having the Covenant with the Promiſes thereof appertaining to them ratified, ſealed and confirmed to the Infant-ſeed of Believers by an outward Sign or Token conſiſt?</p>
               <p>As previous to the reſolution of this queſtion, two things may be obſerved in general.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Adult-Believers are equally and alike concerned in it with Infants; inaſmuch as whatever Good the Adult have by the ratification, ſealing and confirmation of the Covenant and Promiſes thereof unto them, the ſame Good have Infants by the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ratification and confirmation of the Covenant and Promiſes thereof by an outward Sign and Token unto them and ſo <hi>vice verſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That to have the Covenant and promiſes of it ratified, ſealed and confirmed by an outward Sign and Token, is a Good, is ſufficiently ſecured by the very Inſtitution of a Sign and Token for that end and purpoſe, taken in conjunction with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God inſtituting: and Infinite wiſe and good God would not inſtitute an outward Sign and Token for ſuch and end and purpoſe, did it not, as ſerving to that end and purpoſe, conduce to the Good and Benefit of his People whether Infants or Adult; ſo that it is a Good, is certain, though we ſhould not fully apprehend wherein that Good does conſiſt: But more particularly and directly to the queſtion.</p>
               <p>The great Good of having the Covenant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ified, ſealed and confirmed by an outward
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106622:86"/>Sign or Token, I conceive, conſiſts in the additional aſſurance given unto Men thereby of their injoyment of that Good granted to, and ſetled upon them by the Covenant and promiſes; for though it is certain the verity and faithfulneſs of God is a full and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſurance unto Men of their injoyment of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Good is covenanted and promiſed to them, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the performance of what duty is required on their parts, he is a God <hi>that cannot lye;</hi> but yet the ratification and confirmation of the Covenant and Promiſes by an outward Sign is, <hi>quoad homines,</hi> an additional aſſurance to them that they ſhall enjoy that Good. The caſe is one and the ſame, both in reſpect of the confirmation by a Seal and Token, and by an Oath, the Promiſes as abſolutely conſidered, were as ſure and certain before the Oath of God was given as after, yet the Apoſtle tells us that God confirmed his Promiſe with an Oath, and ſhews the Good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to us thereby, <hi>viz. That we might have more ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6.16, 17, 18. God deals with Men after the manner of Men, and with reſpect to their preſent ſtate of Imperfection. Now the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Seal does add to the confirmation of any Promiſes or Contracts among Men, and gives greater aſſurance of the perſormance of them, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of their injoyment of the Good promiſed to whom or with whom ſuch Promiſes and Contracts are made, than they would do were there no Seal annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: hence we may ſay, that the Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God as taken abſolutely in themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration to their Author, are ſtrengthened and confirmed by the Seal or Token annexed, and conſequently the Seal or Token is a further aſſurance to thoſe with or to whom they are made that they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106622:87"/>ſhall injoy the Good covenanted and promiſed: and beſides, while the People of God are in this ſtate of Imperfection, their Knowledge and Faith are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they are apt to frame their notions of God by what they ſee and experience among Men; hence the adding of a Seal or Token to the Covenant is of great advantage to their Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If any ſhall ſay, It's true, to have the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſes thereof ſealed and confirmed by an outward Sign or Token is in this reſpect a great Good to Adult-Believers, who have a capacity to reflect upon the Sign or Token, and improve it for the advantage of their Faith; but what does this concern Infants, who can make no ſuch uſe or improvement of it as applyed to them? and then what Good is it to them, or wherein does the Good of its being applyed to them conſiſt? Suppoſing the Promiſes to appertain to them, they of themſelves are an infallible ſecurity to them as to their injoyment of the Good promiſed, and as for the Sign and Token, as they have no Faith to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſo had they any, yet they are utterly incapable of making any improvement of it to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>To that I ſhall only ſay: Firſt, that the Covenant and-Promiſes, as entred with and made to them, taken abſolutely in themſelves, being ratified, ſealed and confirmed by an outward Sign or Token, the Good contained in them is more fully afcertained and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to them. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let it be obſerved what reference and ſubſerviency according to the revealed will of God the Application of the Token of the Covenant to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants has to his continuing unto them their Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and anſwerably vouchſafing them the Good covenanted and promiſed to them: The Lord himſelf
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106622:87"/>tells <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>the Man-child that was not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed had broken the Covenant,</hi> Gen. 17.14. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that will prove that the Infant-ſeed of the People of God their having the Token of the Covenant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to them, and bearing it, be an indiſpenſible condition of their holding their Covenant-intereſt and ſtate, and injoying the Good promiſed, I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; only this may be ſaid, that the bare priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or want of Circumciſion was not to be accounted a breach of the Covenant; for then all dying before the eighth day had been deprived of the Benefit of the Covenant, and conſequently <hi>David</hi> could not have comforted himſelf by that Conſideration, that he ſhould go to his Child, and not it return to him, ſays <hi>Gerhard, Eam</hi> (ſcil.) <hi>comminationem quae de Circumciſione extat,</hi> Gen. 17.14. <hi>Non ad caſum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vationis, ſed ad contemptum Sacramenti pertinere;</hi> but whether the neglect of it from errour as well as contempt, might not be of ſuch a fatal conſequence to the Child, will appear at that day, when things now hidden are brought to light. This muſt be added, that 'tis a paſſage might juſtly make the hearts not only of Contemners, but of all Neglecters of Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Baptiſm to tremble; we know not but that God may have made the Application of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Infant-ſeed of his People abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his continuing his Covenant to them, and to his vouchſafing them the Benefits of it; he may oſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Covenant upon what terms himſelf pleaſes; and if this ſhould be found true, it is eaſie to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how much the intereſt of the Seed of Believers in the Covenant and Promiſes is ſtrengthened by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them, and conſequently how great a Good it is to them:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106622:88"/>The ſprinkling of the bloud of the Paſchal Lamb up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the door-poſts of the houſes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not be improved by any of their firſt-born who were yet in their pure Infant-ſtate, yet was neceſſary to their ſecurity from the deſtroying Angel: there may be an indiſpenſible connexion between ſome duties and the injoyment of Good promiſed, the reaſon of which lyes in the alone Will and Pleaſure of God, at leaſt is reſerved as a ſecret in his own breſt: Two things are plain to me, and a third is doubtful.</p>
               <p>Firſt, 'Tis plain to me, that in caſe the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have no intereſt in the Covenant, nor are to have the Token of it applyed, Parents have no other ground in Scripture for their hope that they ſhall reap any of the ſaving Benefics purchaſed by Chriſt, at leaſt that dye in their Infancy, then may be acted with reference to the Seed of the worſt of Heathens.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is alike plain to me, that all the Seed of Believers through their intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Promiſes thereof and having the Token of the Covenant applyed to them, do, ſuppoſing their death in their pure Infant-ſtate, infallibly injoy all thoſe Bleſſings and Benefits.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is doubtful to me, how God will deal with, and what is the caſe of their Infant-ſeed, who through the darkneſs of their underſtandings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim their Intereſt in the Covenant, and neglect thereupon to apply the Token of the Covenant to them; I would hope the beſt, but I muſt ſay the Scriptures to me give more ground of fear than of hope.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place it muſt be conſidered, that the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant is applyed to the Infant-ſeed of Believers not only with reference to their Good and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106622:88"/>Benefit during their pure Infant-ſtate, but alſo with reference to their Good as they grow up to years of Maturity, when they are capable of making an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it; and how great it may be, and, if they were inſtructed in the uſe they are to make of it, it will be then unto them, ſhall if the Lord will be ſhewed under the next general Head. But before I proceed to that, ſome doubts that may ariſe from, and ſome Objections that may ſeem to oppoſe what has been hitherto ſaid. muſt be ſatisfied and removed out of the way. We have ſeen a twofold Good and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that the Infant-ſeed of Believers have by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Token of the Covenant to them. Firſt, They have thereby a ſolemn admiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation into the viſible Body, Kingdom or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſt, whereunto, and as the ground of which, they are ſuppoſed and granted, yea affirmed to have a Political or Relative Union with Chriſt the Head. Secondly, They have thereby the Covenant with the Promiſes thereof ſealed and confirmed to them in the ratification of the Covenant; they have conſequently a diſcharge and immunity from the guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning power of Original ſin ſealed and confirmed to them in the ratification and confirmation of the Promiſes; they have a preſent intereſt and propriety in God, and right to future Salvation ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to them.</p>

That fully anſwered. The fourth raiſed from the inconſiſtency of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo much to all the Seed of Believers with the Doctrine of Election. That fully anſwered.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. POſſibly ſome, notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid, will yet urge utter improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that God ſhould proceed ſo far in the expreſſions of his Grace and Love to the Infant-ſeed of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and grant them ſo great and ſo many Priviledges,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106622:89"/>as hath been affirmed he doth, and yet not regenerate and ſanctifie them, if not in their Infancy, yet as they grow up to years of Maturity; and conſequently the Baptiſm of Infants, as grounded upon a ſuppoſition of their being Confederats with their Parents in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. will very probably prove. or rather abſolutely neceſſitate the Doctrine of falling from, and loſing ſaving Grace, and overthrow the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saints Perſeverance. And may be they will ſay, this may be rationally concluded on a fourfold ground yet unanſwered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is utterly improbable that any ſhould have an union with Chriſt, a diſcharge from the guilt of Original ſin, a propriety in God, be owned by him as his People, and have an actual right to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are not regenerated and ſanctified.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is alike utterly improbable that God ſhould expreſs ſo much Grace and Love to, do ſo much for, and confer ſo great Priviledges and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits upon any that he hath not elected, nor ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring to Salvation; but on the other hand purpoſed to, and anſwerably doth leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be fitted by their own ſin and apoſtacy as veſſels of wrath and deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is alike improbable that any ſhould be in Covenant with the Holy Ghoſt, and yet have no benefit by him, either in regard of his ſaving Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or any other Operations that have a direct ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to their future Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Token of the Covenant hath ſuch a reference to Regeneration and Sanctification, as that doth, if not neceſſarily, yet very probably prove that they are, at leaſt ſhall be regenerated and ſanctified, who have <hi>coram Deo</hi> a right to it.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:106622:90"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though I conceive this Objection hath been ſufficiently obviated by what hath been already ſaid, yet ſeeing the grounds it is bottomed upon are plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and have a ſeeming weight in them, I ſhall ſpeak a little more to it, and ſhall</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shew the inſufficiency of theſe grounds to prove what is inferred and concluded from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew the rationality, yea neceſſarineſs, <hi>(Conſideratis conſiderandis)</hi> that God ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo far in his vouchſafements to the Infant-ſeed of his People, and yet not proceed to their univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or Sanctification, no nor abſolutely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf to regenerate or ſanctifie any of them. To begin with the</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, And thus the inſufficiency of theſe grounds will appear by a diſtinct conſideration of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then what is ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that in caſe God hath done ſo much for, and vouchſafed ſo much to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſeed of Believers as hath been affirmed, then it may ſeem utterly improbable but that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and ſanctifie them: for can it be imagined that God ſhould grant unto any an union with Chriſt, diſcharge them from the guilt of ſin, bring them ſo nigh to, and give them a propriety in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and a right to future Salvation, who are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified; but on the other hand are in their natural pollution, deprived of his Image, vitiated and corrupted with the ſeeds and principles of all manner of ſin? will an infinitely holy God do all that for unholy ones, for thoſe that are unregenerated, ſpiritually dead, and in their blood? Sure it cannot be; either they muſt be regenerated, and at leaſt the ſeeds and habits of Grace wrought in them, or no
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106622:90"/>ſuch Priviledges can be rationally ſuppoſed to be granted to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Were but the thoughts and imaginations of men wholly ſubdued unto Chriſt, no other reply were neceſſary, ſave only what our Lord Chriſt made to him that murmured, when thoſe that came laſt into the Vineyard had an equal reward with thoſe that came firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Is it not lawful to do what he will with his own?</hi> Shall any man's eye be evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is good? If God will do ſo much for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſeed of his People, though it goes no farther, who can with any ſhew of reaſon except againſt him? nay have not all cauſe to admire and adore his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and condeſcenſion. Shall vain man undertake to dictate unto God, or injoyn him his way? And therefore this may well be diſmiſt as wholly inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove the concluſion inferred from it. I ſhall therefore only add; If we conſider the infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God to ſinners, yea Adult as well as Infants, and that it is only during their Infant-ſtate, or before the habits and principles of ſin exert themſelves in dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward groſs acts to an apoſtatizing from him that all this is done for, and vouchſafed to them; as alſo that what he doth for them is in a peculiar manner out of love and reſpect to their Parents; we ſhould ſoon ſee this is ſo far from being improbable, that it is rather highly probable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the ſecond thing pleaded, namely the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability that God ſhould go ſo far, and vouchſafe ſo great Priviledges to thoſe that he hath not elected, or appointed to Salvation, and whom, after he hath done ſo much for, he will yet leave to themſelves, and ſuffer them to fall away and finally periſh. And thus it may be ſaid, if God bears no other love to them than
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106622:91"/>he doth to the Non-elect, why doth he do ſo much for them, and grant them ſo great Priviledges? if he doth bear a greater love to them than he bears to the reſt of Mankind, why doth he leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuffer them to forfeit the Priviledges he hath afore vouchſafed to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I cannot apprehend why this ſhould be lookt upon at all as improbable, eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe three or four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What a bleſſed ſtate Man at his firſt Creation was put into; how great Priviledges were granted to him, and to all Mankind in him; and yet we know God did after ſuffer him to fall, and all Mankind in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we conſider how much God doth ſtill for, and how great Priviledges he ſtill vouchſafes to the Non-elect, as well as the Elect, and that in a ſubſerviency to their future Salvation. And what is pleaded to evince the improbability of God's going ſo far, and doing ſo much for the Non-elect Seed of Believers, and yet after leaving them to themſelves, may with the like ſtrength of reaſon be pleaded againſt his doing ſo much for, and granting ſuch Priviledges to the Adult, who are not elected, and anſwerably who are left to the blindneſs of their own minds, and hardneſs of their own hearts to their final ruine and deſtruction. This is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that as for the external means of Salvation, with various Priviledges and Advantages ſubordinate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they are indifferently vouchſafed both to the Elect and the Non-elect. How great and how many Priviledges and Advantages had the <hi>Jews</hi> in general ſubſerving their Salvation, and yet how great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them appertained not to the election of Grace, is known unto all. And hence,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:106622:91"/>3. That God ſhould do ſo much for, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe ſo great Priviledges to the Seed of Believers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and that with a direct reference to their future Salvation, though many among them appertain not to the election of Grace, will appear leſs improbable, if we conſider the rationality that God ſhould do more, and vouchſafe greater Priviledges and Advantages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and that with reference to their Salvation, than he doth for, and vouchſafe to the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The peculiar Love and Favour he bears to his People makes this very rational, yea, I may ſay, ſomewhat neceſſary. It cannot be rationally ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that, when God bears ſo great a love to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, he ſhould do ſomewhat more, and vouchſafe greater Advantages to their Seed, in a ſubſerviency to their future Salvation, than he doth for, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to others. And yet</p>
               <p n="4">4. This will ſeem leſs improbable, if we conſider that in what God doth for, and vouchſafes to the Seed of his People, he hath a peculiar reſpect to the Elect among them. 'Tis in ſpecial for their ſakes that the Priviledges of the Seed of Believers are ſo great. It hath pleaſed God to make his choice of Perſons to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very much in the lines of particular Perſons; hence he uſually caſts Elect Children upon Elect Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; though he hath left a liberty to himſelf to paſs by whom he pleaſeth, and ſometimes to take in ſuch who are of the lines and poſterity of the wicked; yet his Election lies very much in and among the Seed of Elect Parents, and for their ſakes, and in a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to their Salvations, he doth ſo much for, and vouchſafes ſo great Priviledges to the Seed of his People in general. That all the Seed of Believers ſhould have been elected to Salvation, would have been attended
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106622:92"/>with great inconveniencies, and that upon divers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, as might eaſily be ſhewed; yet it hath pleaſed God to lay his Election very much among them. 'Tis rare but that ſome one or more of the Seed of believing Parents evidence their Election by a perſonal taking hold of the Covenant, as they grow up to years of Maturity. Yea it is ſometimes found, that all the Seed of ſome believing Parents give good ground to hope they are ſuch as God hath ordained to life. Now with reſpect to them, and for their ſakes God hath done ſo much, and vouchſafed ſo great Priviledges to their Seed in general: ſo that all things conſidered, that God ſhould grant the Priviledges aſſigned to the Seed of Believers, and yet after leave ſome of them to themſelves, and ſuffer them to forfeit their own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and finally periſh, carries not the leaſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For that which may yet further be pleaded, <hi>viz.</hi> The improbability that any ſhould be in Covenant with the holy Spirit, and yet have no benefit by him, either in regard of any ſaving, no, nor any common operations that have a direct conducency to their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Salvation. To that I would ſay in the general, that how improbable ſoever this may ſeem to be, yet no ſound Argument can be drawn therefrom, to prove the Concluſion inferred in the forementioned Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. God may receive the Infant-ſeed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers into Covenant with himſelf, and that univerſally, and vouchſafe them all the Good and all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges afore aſſigned to them, and yet it will not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow from thence, that any ſuch Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit ſhould be granted to them. This is evident from what hath been already ſaid, yea let me
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106622:92"/>ſay, this is no way improbable. This will appear, if we conſider two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What intereſt and hand the Spirit of God hath in all that is done for, and vouchſafed to them; hence it cannot be ſaid they have no benefit by him. This might be abundantly evidenced, but that I ſhould inlarge this diſcourſe quite beyond the bounds deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it: And therefore</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the ſpecial office and work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and thus we ſhall find the office and work of the Spirit more eſpecially relate to the fitting and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Elect unto Glory, through their Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and chearful performance of holy obedience unto God in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. Now it is vaſtly more improbable, that the Spirit ſhould perform any part of that work whereunto he is deſigned for the preparing veſſels of Mercy unto Glory upon the hearts of the Non-elect, than that, though in Covenant with him, he ſhould ſuſpend the performance of that work in or upon them: Eſpecially if we conſider</p>
               <p n="3">3. What hath been already ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Promiſes of the Covenant conſtituting a Covenant-relation between God, both abſolutely and perſonally conſidered, and the Seed of Believers, as taken abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and by themſelves only, oblige the ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the divine eſſence to act for their Good, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Advantage, according to the tenour of the Covenant, that is according to the diſtinct Promiſes of the Covenant, and the terms or conditions upon which they are made. Now there being no Promiſe made to the individual Infants of Believers, aſſuring them of any ſuch Operations of the Spirit, hence the Spirit is under no obligation to vouchſafe them to this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106622:93"/>or that individual Infant, antecedent to their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal taking hold of the Covenant; which that the Elect ſhall do, is ſecured as by the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son; ſo by thoſe indefinite Promiſes of divine teachings and the like, made to the Church in general, of which before; ſo that here is yet nothing improbable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, That which is pleaded to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the Concluſion in the Objection, is the reference that the Token of the Covenant, whether Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Baptiſm, had or hath to Regeneration and Sanctification. And thus it is ſuppoſed by many to have ſuch a reference as lays a ſure ground for the Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that in caſe Infants have ſuch an union with Chriſt, and Covenant-relation unto, and intereſt in God as intitles them to the Token of the Covenant, they muſt be granted to be regenerated, and thereby initially ſanctified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Token of the Covenant hath ſome reference to Regeneration and Sanctification is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from thoſe Texts uſually inſiſted upon; <hi>John</hi> 3.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. but what that reference is, is not agreed on by all. Some ſay it is an outward Sign or Symbol of Regeneration, and conſequently an evidence of the Party's preſent Regeneration to whom it is applyed, and ſometimes it is called by the men of this perſwaſion a Seal of Regeneration. Others attribute the conferring of the holy Spirit to it, by whom Regeneration is wrought, and ſo they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit is ordinarily communicated, if not by, yet in a concomitancy with the Application of the Token of the Covenant, by means whereof at leaſt the Seeds and Principles of Regeneration, at leaſt ſome kind of diſpoſition leading thereunto, are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106622:93"/>wrought in all that have it rightfully applyed to them. Now I ſhall not ſtay upon a particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of theſe different apprehenſions of Men. It may ſuffice to ſhew that the Token of the Covenant may have and hath a true and proper reference to Regeneration, on the account of which thoſe alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it, made uſe of by Chriſt, and the Apoſtle in the places forementioned, are genuine and proper; and yet the Concluſion pleaded for cannot be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inferred therefrom. And thus we may allow the Token of the Covenant to have a twofold reference to Regeneration and Sanctification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſignificative of both, as the way through which the Elect are prepared for, and brought into Glory. Hence that Alluſion requires not that Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration antecede, nor yet that the Spirit be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by, or in a concomitancy with the Application of the Token of the Covenant, it only ſuppoſeth the Token to be of ſuch uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignifie and repreſent the way through which God doth bring his Elect to Salvation; and it is only a Sign of preſent Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Adult, as the Application of it to them doth ſuppoſe them Heirs of Salvation that way, <hi>viz.</hi> through Regeneration and renewing of the Spirit; but in reſpect of thoſe that are Heirs another way, <hi>viz.</hi> through the Promiſe made to them as the Seed of ſuch Parents, it only ſignifies and repreſents the way how they ſhall, ſuppoſing them ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, be brought to Salvation; but whether they are already regenerated, or yet to be regenerated, cannot be determined from that Alluſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Token of the Covenant refers to Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it is a ſeal and confirmation of the Promiſes of Regeneration; but then it can only ſeal and confirm
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106622:94"/>thoſe Promiſes according to their nature and tenour, and conſequently the Promiſes being only indefinite, reſpecting the Seed of Believers in general, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, the ſealing and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be anſwerable. And thus it ſhall be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that God by the Token of the Covenant as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Seed of his People, doth ſeal and confirm unto them thoſe Promiſes of divine teachings, putting his Laws in the minds, and writing them in the hearts of their Seed. Hence the Promiſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. is expreſſed in that phraſe, <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy Seed;</hi> plainly ſhewing that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion (and the ſame is true of Baptiſm) hath ſome reference to the Converſion and Regeneration of their Seed; and that was this; it did ſeal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Promiſes concerning the Converſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of their Seed, which Promiſes being (as I have ſaid) only indefinite, the ſealing muſt needs be proportionable: So that though we grant, yea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the Infant-ſeed of Believers have all that Good, and all thoſe Priviledges afore expreſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to them, yet it will not neceſſarily follow, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be certainly concluded from thence, that they are, or ſhall be truly regenerated or ſanctified. God may proceed ſo far in the expreſſions of his Grace and Love to them, and yet there is no neceſſity he ſhould proceed to their Regeneration or Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor yet oblige himſelf thereunto. As for thoſe preparatory Operations of the Spirit, whereby ſome kind of prediſpoſitions towards a work of Grace, or a <hi>poſſe agere</hi> are wrought in them, though I conceive they may be granted without prejudice to thoſe great Doctrines of ſpecial Grace and Perſeverance; ſeing it is certain, thore are many common works of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106622:94"/>Spirit granted to thoſe that never attain to true Grace, yet I conceive it is not neceſſary, that we do hold them to be granted to all the Infant-ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, no not to all, yea or any of the Elect among them. God may take the Infant-ſeed of his People into Covenant with himſelf together with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and thereby ſet them free from the condemning power of Original ſin, put himſelf under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to act as a God towards them, according to the tenour of the Covenant into which they are taken, appoint the Token of the Covenant to be applyed to them, and thereby admit them into the Church or Kingdom of Chriſt as viſible, and vouchſafe them all thoſe Priviledges of his Church aforementioned, and yet not vouchſafe them any Operations of the Spirit whether ſpecial or common.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is very rational to ſuppoſe, that though God hath expreſſed his Grace and Love to the Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed of his People in all thoſe glorious vouchſafements before expreſſed, yet that he ſhould not proceed to their univerſal Regeneration and Sanctification, but ſhould leave to himſelf a liberty, ſavingly to work upon whom he pleaſeth, in a complyance with his eternal Purpoſe and Decree, and that when, and by what means he pleaſeth, as himſelf ſees meet. This will appear from a threefold Conſideration,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, That it is altogether unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, yea morally impoſſible, that God ſhould conſtitute a conditional Covenant between himſelf and Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Infants or Adult, and yet ſhould include the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition required of Men in, and thereby ſecure their performance of it by any Promiſe that is of the eſſence and ſubſtance of the Covenant as ſo conſidered. This is evident from what hath been already ſaid, for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106622:95"/>this would quite alter and change the nature of the Covenant, it would not then be a conditional, and conſequently any Covenant at all in a proper ſenſe, but an abſolute Covenant, or rather a <hi>compendium,</hi> or <hi>ſynopſis</hi> of abſolute Promiſes. And beſides, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt be ſuppoſed to have an Intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, before the condition of their Intereſt is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them, which (as I have ſaid) is an abſolute contradiction. Hence it will undeniably follow, that the Promiſes of the firſt Grace are not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Covenant as conditionally made with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, but appertain to the Covenant, as made with the Church or Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> collectively conſidered, and ſecure to the Elect the Grace required on Man's part to his admiſſion into, or continuance in the Covenant, as conditionally made with particular Perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how rational it is to ſuppoſe that God ſhould (as it is certain he doth) require ſomething of duty from Parents towards their Children, or ſomething of duty from Children themſelves, if not from both; upon the performance of, or failing in which he ſhould continue, or diſcontinue their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-ſtate when they grow up to years of Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The rationality of this ſuppoſal appears from the conformity and agreeableneſs of his ſo doing, to his dealings with all thoſe he either offers his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to, or enters Covenant with. Take it of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers to whom the Covenant is offered, there is ſomething of duty required on their parts in order to their reception into Covenant, they are to take hold of it. Take it of Believers with whom the Covenant is actually entred; thus. There is no good promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but ſomething of duty is required on their parts
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106622:95"/>in order to the injoyment of it, and upon their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of that duty, they may be and uſually are deprived of it: And why ſhould it not be alike rational, that God ſhould require ſomewhat of duty from them towards their Children, upon the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of which he ſhould withhold the Good promiſed, or ſhould <hi>not bring upon them</hi> (as God ſpeaks concerning <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>the Good promiſed?</hi> Yea in order to the continuance of that Covenant-ſtate between God and themſelves, there is ſomewhat of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty required on their parts, the performance of which, it's true, is ſecured to them another way; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duty is required on their parts, upon their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of which (might we ſuppoſe that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) their Covenant-ſtate would be diſcontinued, or they would be caſt out of Covenant. And why ſhould it not be alike rational for God to require ſomewhat of duty from Children themſelves, in order to the continuance of their Covenant-ſtate, when they grow up to a capacity of performing it, which that they ſhall univerſally do, it is no way neceſſary ſhould be ſecured to them, as we may ſee more by and by. So that God's dealings with reference to the Seed of Believers are altogether rational, as ſuiting with his dealings with all Men to whom he offers his Covenant, or with whom he doth actually eſtabliſh it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that in caſe either God had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far in extending his Covenant and Promiſes, and thereby vouchſafing to the Infant-ſeed of his People that Good and thoſe Priviledges afore decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; or had proceeded further, <hi>viz.</hi> to their univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Regeneration, or to the ſecuring it unto them;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106622:96"/>one of theſe inconveniencies would have neceſſarily followed thereupon, either</p>
               <p n="1">1. No Infants muſt have dyed in their Infancy, which yet that innumerable do, our dayly obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſſures us: Or elſe,</p>
               <p n="2">2. All Infants dying in their Infancy muſt have eternally periſhed, and been everlaſtingly <hi>ſeparated from the preſence of God and the glory of his Power:</hi> Or,</p>
               <p n="3">3. In caſe any were ſaved, it muſt be, not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant of Grace entred with, or any Promiſe made unto them, but merely from an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power and prerogative in God to ſave or condemn whom he will of faln Mankind, without reſpect had to the Covenant of Grace eſtabliſhed in the Blood of Chriſt: Or,</p>
               <p n="4">4. All the Seed of Believers, whether dying in their Infancy, or living to years of Maturity, muſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be ſaved: Or,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Some might be truly regenerated, and have a ſaving work of Grace upon their hearts, and yet after finally fall away and eternally periſh. In caſe he ſhould not have extended his Covenant to the Seed of his People, as our Oppoſers imagine, or if he had extended it to them definitely, and yet they ſhould not have had that Good, and thoſe Priviledges plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; then one of the three former inconveniencies would have followed: or if having ſo extended his Covenant to them, he ſhould thereby have obliged himſelf to work Grace in them univerſally; then the one or the other of the two latter inconveniences would have followed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be ſaid, the Covenant and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may be made indefinitely with, and to the Seed of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106622:96"/>Believers, and then none of theſe inconeniences will follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer. I have before proved that they do appertain to them definitely; or ſuppoſe we ſhould grant them to appertain to them only inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, yet this inconveniency would follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Covenant gives no aſſurance that any of their Infants (who have one or more ſurviving their pure Infant-ſtate, and growing up to years of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) dying in their Infancy ſhalll be ſaved: So Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have no certain ground to hope that any one of theirs ſo dying are ſaved. That none have any certain ground to hope for what the Covenant gives no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of, will be readily granted on all hands. Now ſuppoſe the Covenant or Promiſes are entred with, and made to the Seed of Believers only indefinitely, that they give no aſſurance that all, yea or any of the Seed of ſuch Believers dying in their Infancy ſhall be ſaved, will evidently appear thus; becauſe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may ſtand firm, and the Promiſes of it fully accompliſhed in the Converſion and Salvation of ſome one or more of thoſe that ſurvive their Infant-ſtate, and grow up to years of Maturity. And hence by the way, how can a ſuppoſal of that be a ſufficient ground for the Application of the Token of the Covenant, of which the Covenant gives no aſſurance? And further I conceive, it will and muſt be granted by thoſe that conceive the Covenant is entred only indefinitely with the Seed of Believers, that it gives aſſurance of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Infants dying in their Infancy, only ſo far as it gives aſſurance to them of Regeneration in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Now it is evident that the Covenant gives no aſſurance of Regeneration to any of the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in their pure Infant ſtate: If it give aſſurance
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106622:97"/>to any of Regeneration in that ſtate, it is either as they are Elect, or as they are the Seed of ſuch Parents, or by vertue of ſome Revelation that God hath made in his Word, that he will regenerate, at leaſt ſome of the Seed of his People, as having the Covenant ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with them in their Infancy: But now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Covenant doth not aſſure any of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation in their Infancy, as they are Elect, for then all the Elect Seed of Believers ſhould be regenerated in their Infancy; the contrary whereunto is evident, in that many of the Seed of Believers, in whom there is not the leaſt ſhew or appearance of Grace from their very Infancy till they come to full age, yea poſſibly till they come to old age, are yet at laſt converted and brought to a ſaving cloſe with Chriſt. To ſay that theſe might have a work of Grace in their Infancy will be attended with too bad conſequences than to be granted, without better proof than I ſuppoſe can be brought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Covenant doth not give aſſurance of Regeneration to the Seed of Believers in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as ſuch, will, I doubt not, be readily granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further proof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God hath no where revealed that he would regenerate any of the Seed of his People in their Infancy, is ſufficiently proved from the utter ſilence of the Scriptures as to any ſuch Revelation. And for any to plead experience or obſervation in this caſe, that can ſignifie but little, inaſmuch as that Grace ſome of the Seed of Believers have, of the time or means, when or whereby it was wrought, they can give no account; it might yet be wrought either by Parental Inſtruction, or ſome other means vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106622:97"/>conſequent to their pure Infant-ſtate. Now then the Covenant giving no aſſurance of the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of any of the Seed of Believers in their pure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſtate, it gives no aſſurance of any of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently Parents have no certain ground to bottom a hope upon, that any of theirs dying in their Infant-ſtate are ſaved. All the hope they can have hath only a poſſibility, or at utmoſt a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for its foundation; and that, it may be too, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a greater probability of the contrary, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vaſtly more rational to me to ſuppoſe, that, in caſe the Covenant were entred with them only indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing God hath given no aſſurance that he would regenerate any in their Infancy, and in doing it when they come to years of Maturity, he makes good his Promiſe as fully, as though he did it in their Infancy; he ſhould ſuffer thoſe that he hath ordained to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to live to years of Maturity, and anſwerably bring them to Glory according to his ordinary way, viz. <hi>through Sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth, called thereunto by the Goſpel,</hi> than that he ſhould go out of his ordinary way, and regenerate them immediately by his Spirit, without the ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency of any outward means, eſpecially conſidering what inconveniencies would attend, through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Men, a ſuppoſition of his ſo doing, and conſequently that believing Parents, if they muſt not mourn as thoſe that have no hope, yet they could not but mourn, as having but little hope. But now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the way that I have proceeded in, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant and Promiſes to be entred and made to the Seed of Believers definitely, and allowing them to have all that Good aſſigned to them by vertue of their Intereſt in the Covenant and Promiſes thereof,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106622:98"/>and yet bounding that Good, as I have done, unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Good accrews to them by that their Covenant-intereſt, and the Application of the Token of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and yet none of theſe inconveniencies enſue thereupon. From the whole of what hath been ſaid, as we ſee it cannot be rationally concluded, that, in caſe God goes ſo far in the expreſſions of his Love and Grace to the Seed of his People, as to grant them that Good, thoſe Priviledges and Benefits, as hath been declared he doth, that then he muſt neceſſarily go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and actually regenerate and ſanctifie them, either in their Infancy, or as they grow up to years of Maturity: So that it is very rational to ſuppoſe that he ſhould go ſo far, as hath been expreſt, and yet ſhould go no further, but ſhould reſerve a liberty to himſelf, as to regenerate and ſanctifie whom he pleaſeth, ſo to do it when, and by what means himſelf pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>And from all, I conceive, an Argument might be drawn, an anſwer unto which would (if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not) be clogged with no ſmall difficulties, both to prove the Covenant-intereſt of the Seed of Believers, and the dueneſs of the Application of the Token thereof to them upon the account thereof, and alſo to confirm their injoyment of all that Good, and all thoſe Priviledges and Benefits affirmed to accrew to them. But I ſhall not ſtay upon it: I conceive both are ſufficiently done already. Let me rather excite all Men to admire the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God in doing ſo much for the Seed of his People, and yet providing for the free exerciſe of his own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over and among them, as well as others, and his Juſtice in condemning none, but ſuch as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſin away their own Mercies.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:106622:98"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. It will be ſaid, 'Tis true the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and that univerſally, viſibly appear to us, and may be hoped according to a judgment of Charity, to have all that Good, and all thoſe Benefits and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges afore aſſigned to them, as they are the Seed of ſuch Parents, conferred upon and enſured to them by the Covenant, as confirmed by the Application of the Token thereof to them: but that they have all that Good, and all thoſe Benefits and Priviledges really and truly actually granted to, and conferred upon them in their pure Infant-ſtate, is more than we can affirm; inaſmuch as ſecret things belong to God, but things revealed to us and our Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs, moſt that have pleaded for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm upon this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> their Intereſt in the Covenant, do too commonly expreſs themſelves to this purpoſe; but it ſeems paſt all rational doubt, and is ſo to me, that what they viſibly appear to have by vertue of their Intereſt in the Covenant, that they have in reality and truth. Hence as they do not ſo much as viſibly appear to have a real work of Grace upon their hearts, there being no Promiſe ſecuring that to them; ſo for all the Good and all the Benefits and Bleſſings afore aſſigned to them, they have them in reality and truth. This is evident from a double Conſideration;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, That they are the Seed of true Believers, ſuch as have truly and really performed the conditions of the Covenant of Grace, and conſequently are really and internally in Covenant themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Seed of Believers Intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and having all that Good, and all thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits granted and conferred upon them thereby, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not at all upon any qualifications in, or any
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106622:99"/>act or duty performed by them themſelves, but flows merely from the Promiſes of the Covenant appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them as the Seed of ſuch Parents. Hence in caſe they only viſibly appear to us to have all that Good, and all thoſe Priviledges before mentioned granted to, and conferred upon them, it muſt be either, becauſe the Promiſes only viſibly appear to us to appertain to them; or that all that Good, and all thoſe Bleſſings only ſeem, or viſibly appear to us to be containd in, granted and conferred by thoſe Promiſes; or laſtly, becauſe the Promiſes of God do but ſeem or viſibly appear to us to be true and faithful, but ſeem, or viſibly appear to us to grant to, or confer upon thoſe that are truly and really intereſted in them, that Good that is really contained in and intended by them. None of which things can be granted. Not the firſt, for I have before proved that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes do appertain to all the Seed of Believers, (I mean it ſtill of true Believers, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was) and that definitely to each one, or to every one of them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Not the ſecond, for undoubtedly God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that very Good the Promiſes mention. Not the third, for the Promiſes are true and faithful, they do really and truly convey or confer an actual right to the Good contained in them to thoſe, to whom they do really and truly appertain. And from hence it will unavoidably follow, that there is no place for a judgment of Charity to be exerciſed immediately and directly towards Infants. It's true, where we can only exerciſe a judgment of Charity towards Parents, there we can only exerciſe the ſame judgment of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards their Children; but where Parents are known to be true Believers, (as in the inſtance of <hi>Abraham</hi>) there a judgment of Charity hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106622:99"/>to do with reference to their Seed. And we ſpeak of the caſe of the Seed of Believers according to what their Parents are in deed and in truth, or are known to God to be. A judgment of Charity can only be acted towards Men with reference to, or in regard of their having performed the condition of the Promiſes, and conſequently to their right to thoſe Promiſes: But in the caſe of the Infants I ſpeak of both theſe are certain. Hence undeniably what they viſibly appear to have, they have in reality and truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. It may be objected, That to grant the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and that univerſally, all thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Priviledges afore aſſigned to them in truth and reality, will greatly weaken, if not utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Doctrine of Saints Perſeverance: For we muſt then grant that ſome, who had a true and real Union with Chriſt, are diſcharged from the guilt and condemning power of ſin; have a true and proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God as their God; and a preſent right to Salvation, may yet fall away and finally periſh: For ſo it is certain ſome of the Seed of Believers do. Now if Union with Chriſt, a Covenant-ſtate with God, a diſcharge from the guilt of ſin, Propriety in God, and right to future Salvation, will ſecure none from Apoſtacy and finally periſhing, what aſſurance can any have that they ſhall not fall away and finally periſh? And thus while we endeavour to promote the joy and comfort of Saints one way, we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it another: while we endeavour to promote their joy and comfort, by eſtabliſhing their Childrens Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, and aſſigning them ſo much Good, and ſo many Priviledges as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted therein, we ſhall deſtroy their joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by weakning the grounds of aſſurance, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106622:100"/>have had of their own continuance in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-ſtate Godwards; while we endeavour to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh their Childrens Covenant-ſtate, we ſhall leave them deſtitute of any ſure ground that themſelves ſhall be continued in theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What Union the Infant-ſeed of Believers, as ſuch have with Chriſt; what ſins they are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the guilt and condemning power of; from whence their diſcharge from the guilt and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of ſin doth ariſe and accrew to them; how far, and upon what terms the Promiſes giving them an Intereſt and Propriety in God lays an obligation upon him to communicate himſelf to, or act for their Good; as alſo what right they have to future Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the terms upon which they alone can actually injoy it (ſuppoſing their growth up to years of Maturity) are, hath been already declared, and muſt be carefully remembred: which being remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and well weighed, I ſee no juſt reaſon, why the aſſignment of any or all thoſe Benefits and Priviledges, as afore explained and limited to them, ſhould be lookt upon as of the tendency mentioned. This I doubt not to affirm, though we grant all that hath been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, and merely as ſuch; yet the Doctrine of Saints Perſeverance may be founded upon ſuch ſure baſes, and maintained by ſuch Scripture demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as that it ſhall ſtand firm, maugre the utmoſt oppoſition that can be made againſt it; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but their own deficiency in point of Faith, and aſſurance that themſelves are ſuch, and the due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that aſſurance, can juſtly deprive any true Believer of the higheſt Plerophorie, that the Scriptures give an incouragement to endeavour after.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106622:100"/>To attempt the fixing of that Doctrine upon its true baſis, or improving and managing the various Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which it may be eſtabliſhed, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrical to my preſent undertaking: yet let me ſay only thus much, that the aſſurance the Scripture gives us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an Election of Grace, not only of Perſons ſo and ſo qualified, but of individual Perſons to be ſo and ſo qualified.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all appertaining thereunto are given of the Father unto Chriſt, with an explicite expreſſion of his will to him, that he ſhould loſe none of them, but ſhould raiſe them up at the laſt day, <hi>viz.</hi> to the life of Glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Covenant of Grace is immutable, when once that, <hi>viz.</hi> the Spirit, which renders it ſo, is actually given.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the ſpiritual life of all Believers is laid up, and hidden with Chriſt in God, and that both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the principle, and conſerving cauſe of it; and hence,</p>
               <p n="5">5. That there is an unſeparable connexion between effectual Vocation and Glorification; I ſay, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the Scriptures give us of theſe things, with ſeveral others of the like importance, ſecures that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to the joy and comfort, yea and that unſpeakable and full of Glory, of all Saints, though all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Priviledges afore declared are granied to all the Infant-ſeed of Believers, among whom yet many finally fall away and periſh: So that I conceive, that as what hath been granted to the Infant-ſeed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, may greatly promote their Parents joy and comfort in them; ſo the granting of it hath no juſt tendency to allay their joy and comfort. The aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106622:101"/>of their own ſtanding in their Covenant-ſtate Godward hath an aptitude to yeeld their Children may have all that Good, and yet their own aſſurance of Perſeverance in Grace, and infallibly coming to Glory, be no way weakned or prejudiced thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Poſſibly ſome may further ſay, To affirm that all the Seed of believing Parents have ſo much Good, and ſo many Benefits and Priviledges by their Intereſt in the Covenant, and the Application of the Token of it unto them, ſeems inconſiſtent with the Doctrine of Election: for among other things it has been affirmed, that they have all univerſally, without any reſpect to Election or Preterition, a preſent right to Salvation, and that ratified, ſealed and comfirmed by the Token of the Covenant; and conſequently that in caſe of their death in their pure Infant-ſtate, they are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaved. Which if ſo, we muſt either grant that ſome, that appertain not to the Election of Grace, are ſaved, which overthrows that Doctrine; or elſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that all that die in their Infancy are elected: which as it is improbable in it ſelf; ſo cannot be proved from Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That all the Infant-ſeed of true Believers dying in their pure Infant-ſtate are infallibly ſaved, is paſt all rational doubt to me: and as for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Election, I apprehend not any ſolid reaſon, why it ſhould ſeem at all inconſiſtent with it, ſeeing it is very rational to ſuppoſe, that all ſuch Infants dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that ſtate do indeed appertain to the Election of Grace. As for what is objected concerning the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of that, and the want of Scripture to prove it, I conceive the quite contrary may be eaſily made to appear, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not only highly probable in it ſelf, but hath countenance from Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:106622:101"/>1. That it is not at all improbable, but rather high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, appears two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the confeſſed dealings of God with the Adult; that no Adult perſon can be ſaved without Regeneration, Faith and Repentance, is poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by our Lord Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. Hence it muſt neceſſarily follow, and is granted by all that own the Doctrine of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God does ſo order his Providence towards Men, that none among the Adult that appertain to the Election of Grace do die before a work of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be wrought in them, which is and muſt be done according to the ordinary way of God's working upon Man by the Word, as ſome way communicated to them: and how often is it found that Men and Women, whoſe lot is caſt in places wholly remote from all ordinary means of Converſion, are yet poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly after many years, either brought to the means of Grace, or they carried to them, whereby they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly wrought upon, and thereby declared to have appertained to the Election of Grace? Now if ſo be the Providence of God for ſo long a time watcheth over ſuch Men, whereby they are preſerved from death: why ſhould it ſeem at all improbable? But on the other hand it is highly probable, that God ſhould order his Providence after the like manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Infants, and anſwerably continue life to the Non-elect, that ſo their falling ſhort of the Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhould be chargeable upon themſelves; and take away by death only the Elect, whoſe Salvation is ſecured by the Promiſe made to them, as the Seed of ſuch Parents: hereby the Salvation of the Elect is ſecured, and the Grace of God therein greatly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; when the Non-elect apoſtatizing from God,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106622:102"/>his Juſtice in their condemnation will ſhine forth in greater brightneſs and Glory. So that for God ſo to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Providence towards the Seed of Believers is ſo far from any improbability, that it is greatly probable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This will further appear, if we conſider on the one hand, the infinite Goodneſs as well as Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, in conjunction with the Covenant and Promiſes entred with, and made to the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and on the other hand, how many of thoſe of their Seed that live to years of Maturity do apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize, grow wicked, and conſequently never injoy the Good covenanted and promiſed to them. It is not unuſally, though very much without ground pleaded by our Oppoſers, as a reaſon why they cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Doctrine and Practice of Infant-Baptiſm, that they can ſee little difference between the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Believers, and the Children of Unbelievers; the Children of the one prove wicked, as well as the Children of the other. Now though this be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and proceeds in a great meaſure from mere prejudice, an evident difference being ordinarily to be ſeen: yet it muſt be confeſt it may be very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expected, that in caſe God has, as we affirm he has, extended his Covenant and Promiſes univerſally to the Seed of his People, more ſhould injoy the Good of them, than can be rationally hoped do, in reſpect of, or among thoſe that live to years of Maturity; though according to the true tenour of the Covenant, the Good of it is not infallibly ſecured to all, no nor to any that grow up to years of Maturity; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Apoſtacy of ſome, no way reflects upon the Faithfulneſs of God; yet when he has extended his Covenant and Promiſes to them, conſidering how Good, and ready to do Good he is, it may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106622:102"/>the appearance of reaſon ſeem ſtrange, that no more injoy that Good, than may be ſuppoſed to do, of thoſe that live to years of Maturity. Hence it is highly probable, that all that die in their Infancy, or ſuch as do indeed appertain to the Election of Grace, and anſwerably do injoy the full Good of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and if we take in all that die in their Infancy, with thoſe that growing up to years of Maturity do give aſſurance of their perſonal taking hold of the Covenant, not only the Faithfulneſs but the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in extending and making good his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Seed of his People, will ſhine forth in their glory and luſtre. And how great a Good is it for the Seed of Believers to be taken into the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their Parents will abundantly appear. The day of Judgment will, I doubt not, fully vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Doctrine and Practice of Infant-Baptiſm from thoſe unjuſt reproaches 'tis now by Men, yea by ſome good Men, in their darkneſs loaded with. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. As this, <hi>viz.</hi> that only ſuch among the Seed of Believers, as appertain to the Election of Grace, are taken away by death in their pure Infant-ſtate, and conſequently that all that are not elected do live to years of Maturity, wants not countenance from Scripture: for let it be obſerved, that we read in Scripture only of two of the Seed of true Believers, whoſe preterition was intimated or made known by ſpecial Revelation from God; and both theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recorded to have lived to years of Maturity, and to have forfeited their Intereſt in the Promiſes, by their own ſin and Apoſtacy, theſe were <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> the one forfeits his Intereſt by perſecuting his Brother, the other by a prophane ſelling his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. That the Preterition, or Non-election of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106622:103"/>both theſe are ſignified by immediate Revelation from God, the Apoſtle ſhews <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. That both lived to years of Maturity, and forfeited their Intereſt the ways forementioned, is expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.29, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rational to ſuppoſe, that as it was with theſe two, the leading Inſtances and Paterns of God's dealings with the Non-elect-Seed of his People: So it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably with all that are not elected. And as we read only of theſe two, whoſe Preterition or Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>election were ſignified by ſpecial Revelation; and we ſee both of them live to years of Maturity, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their Intereſt in the Promiſes, by their own ſin and Apoſtacy: So the Scripture particularly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the death only of one of the Seed of true Believers in their pure Infant-ſtate, and gives ſufficient ground to believe that that did appertain to the Election of Grace: This was <hi>David</hi>'s child by <hi>Bathſheba:</hi> that that child did belong to the Election of Grace, <hi>David</hi> queſtions not, but takes it for granted, as appears by his comforting himſelf upon its death, and profeſſing his Faith, that he ſhould go to it, and not it return to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. Poſſibly ſome will ſay, What hath been pleaded for on the behalf of the Infant-ſeed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, is nothing but what is common to all Infants univerſally; in as much as all Mankind univerſally, as born into the World, are by Chriſt freed from the condemning power of Original ſin, reſtored to the Love and Favour of God, and put into a ſtate of Life and Salvation. And conſequently if any Infants ought to have the Token of the Covenant applyed to them, then all ought alike to have it applyed unto
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106622:103"/>them: and on the other hand, if all ought not, then none ought to have it applyed unto them: Or ſuppoſe it ſhould be granted, that ſome ought to have it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, yet their ſtates and conditions would be no way bettered thereby, ſeeing what Good they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive by it, is common to all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſuppoſe this Objection will not be owned by many, but to thoſe few that may, I would reply, by only asking this one Queſtion; <hi>viz.</hi> How all Mankind come by all that Good? have they it by the Covenant of Grace? or by any other Covenant or Promiſe diſtinguiſhed from and independent upon the Covenant of Grace? or have they it by. a mere reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy from Chriſt, undertaking and performing his Mediatory Office?</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, have they it by the Covenant of Grace? ſure that cannot be; for the Covenant of Grace is only actually eſtabliſhed between God and <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their generations. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their generations.</hi> Now if ſo be the Covenant of Grace had been afore eſtabliſhed with all Mankind, here had been no new Priviledge, or no Priviledge beyond what was common to Man in general, granted unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to any of his Seed. The eſtabliſhment of the Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his Seed in their generations, as contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the reſt of Mankind, evidently proves 'tis not eſtabliſhed with all Mankind; for then the eſtabliſhing of it with him and his Seed had been a mere ſuperfluous and inſignificant thing, ſeeing it had been afore eſtabliſhed with him and his Seed as of the number of Mankind, and that in the ſame ſenſe, and with the like advantage both to him and them as
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106622:104"/>now it is. How far the Covenant is conditionally made, or rather offered to all Men concerns not our preſent purpoſe; ſeeing as ſo made or offered, it actually conveys not the Good promiſed to any, untill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have performed the conditions of it: But that it is actually made, or entred with all Mankind as ſuch, is not only deſtitute of any proof from Scripture, but is directly contrary to the whole tenour of Scriptures. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>ſtrangers to the Covenants of Promiſe</hi> antecedent to their Faith in Chriſt, and thereby becoming <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed. The Promiſes are ſaid to be made <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Men only as in him. Hence <hi>taking hold of the Covenant</hi> is made neceſſary to a right to the Promiſes. But to inſiſt upon this may well be accounted ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, as being a denial of what no body hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Now then, if ſo be the Covenant of Grace, (wherein all the Good aforementioned is contained) be not actually entred and eſtabliſhed with all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as ſuch, then neither all, nor any part of that Good can be come upon all Men, merely as ſuch by the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have they it by vertue of any other Covenant or Promiſe contradiſtinct from, or independent upon the Covenant of Grace? That cannot be, becauſe no ſuch Covenant or Promiſe is to be found throughout the whole Scriptures. Let any ſuch Covenant or Promiſe be ſhewed, and it ſhall be attended to. The only Scripture (ſo far as I can call to mind) that gives the leaſt countenance to this ſuppoſal, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16, 17, 18. But to that I ſhall only ſay two things. Firſt, That the Apoſtle's bare uſing of the univerſal Particle <hi>all,</hi> is too weak a ground to lay ſuch an Aſſertion upon, eſpecially when no Covenant
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106622:104"/>or Promiſe can be found, by, or according to which the gift there ſpoken of is conferred upon all Men; And ſeeing it is evident that that term is ſometimes uſed, when yet it is to be interpreted and underſtood in a limited ſenſe, I need not cite places to thoſe that are at all acquainted with the Scriptures. Secondly, I anſwer, that the Apoſtle's deſign is not to ſhew that the free Gift by Chriſt is of equal extent in the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it with the condemnation ariſing from <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin: but his deſign is to compare <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and the purchaſe made by Chriſt, in regard of their reſpective efficacies, or in point of their reſpective cauſalities, or power to produce their different effects. In brief his deſign is only to ſhew, that ſeeing the offence of one Man, <hi>viz. Adam</hi>'s, was effective of the condemnation of all his Poſterity; then the Grace of God and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, (who is not merely Man, but God-Man) muſt needs be more effectual for their Juſtification and Life, who have an Intereſt in, and Union with him. That this is the Apoſtle's deſign, appears two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, From his aſſignment of a preheminence or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundance to the Grace of God and this free Gift by Chriſt, above what is predicable of the Offence of <hi>Adam;</hi> which muſt needs reſpect the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Grace of God and the free Gift by Chriſt to juſtifie and ſave; and of the Offence of <hi>Adam</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn: for if ſo be we conſider the Perſons upon whom condemnation is come by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offence, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon whom the free Gift is come unto Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Life, no ſuch aſſignment of a preheminence and ſuperabundancy to the Grace of God and the free Gift by Chriſt could be made, inaſmuch as that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is come upon all by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Offence, and the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106622:105"/>free Gift can come but upon all. And where the Objects and Perſons concerned are of equal extent, no preheminency can be aſſigned with reſpect unto them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This appears from the Apoſtle's variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his phraſe from <hi>many</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> and again from <hi>all</hi> to <hi>many,</hi> which plainly ſhews he had not ſo much reſpect to the Perſons upon whom either Condemnation or the free Gift is come, as either to the things come upon them, or to the cauſes and means, from whence, or whereby thoſe things are come upon them reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, Though the Apoſtle tells us the free Gift is come upon all to juſtification of Life; yet he tells us not how, or in what ſenſe, or upon what terms it is come: He may only mean it is come upon all in reſpect of the conditional offer and tender of it: So we may underſtand that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Grace of God hath appeared, bringing Salvation to all Men,</hi> for ſo the Greek exactly runs. The Grace of God hath brought Salvation to all Men in regard of the offer and tender of it, <hi>Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to every Creature:</hi> See the like paſſage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God is revealed to all:</hi> So here the <hi>free Gift is come upon all,</hi> that is in reſpect of the offer and tender of it. For the Apoſtle may ſuppoſe the condition already performed, and only intend its being come upon all them that believe, according to that of the Apoſtle before mentioned, <hi>The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is manifieſt unto all, and upon all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and there is no difference:</hi> So here the free Gift is come upon all to juſtification of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> upon all that believe, and there is no difference. From the whole we may evidently ſee, this Scripture will not prove what is affirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106622:105"/>and that univerſally as born into the World, are freed from the condemnation of the Law, and reſtored to a ſtate of Favour and Life by Chriſt: So that as the Covenant of Grace is not entred with all Mankind in general; ſo there is no other Covenant or Promiſe recorded, or mentioned in the Scriptures, by vertue of which any one, much leſs all Mankind, can have the Good aſſigned to the Infant-ſeed of Believers granted to, or ſetled upon them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Have they it by a mere reſultancy from Chriſt's undertaking and performing the work of Mediation? Sure the groſſneſs of ſuch a ſuppoſition renders any reply to it ſuperfluous. It would be a mere loſs of time to ſuppoſe that which is of it ſelf too abſurd to be affirmed by any. To put then a period to this, If the Covenant of Grace be not actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with all Mankind, and that as ſuch; If there be no other Covenant or Promiſe to be found in Scripture, by vertue of which any unintereſted in the Covenant of Grace can lay claim to that Good and thoſe Benefits and Priviledges granted to, and ſetled upon the Seed of Believers, as Conſederates with their Parents; If that Good, and thoſe Benefits come not upon any by a mere reſultancy from the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, without the intervening of ſome Covenant or Promiſe; then there is no ground to affirm, that the Seed of Believers have as under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſigned and ſealed by the Sign and Token of it, nothing but what is common to Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Only let me add, what will be the caſe of all Infants born of Unbelieving Parents, and dying in their Infancy, and how God will deal with them in reſpect of their eternal ſtates, I ſhall not determine. This is all that I affirm, that as to what God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:106622:106"/>in his Word, the Good, Benefits and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges aſſigned to the Infant-ſeed of Believers are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and proper unto them, and not common to all Infants in general, they only having an actual Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Covenant of Grace; and conſequently as they alone have a right to the Sign and Token of the Covenant, ſo an unſpeakable advantage by that their Covenant-intereſt, and the Application of the Token thereof unto them, above what all other Infants, as to what the Scripture reveals, have. But let that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſecond Benefit or Advantage accrewing to the Infant-ſeed of Believers by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them upon a precedent Intereſt they have in the Covenant it ſelf.</p>

               <p n="3">3. THe third and laſt Benefit or Advantage, that I ſhall take notice of, that the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them, as antecedently intereſted in the Covenant it ſelf, is the ſubſerviency thereof to their perſonal imbracement of the Covenant, and injoyment of all the Good of it, as they grow up to years of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. And here I ſhall only take notice of a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſubſerviency, that the Application of the Token of the Covenant to Infants (ſuppoſing them duely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the end and uſes of it) hath to their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hold of the Covenant, and giving up themſelves to God according to the tenour of it as they grow up to years of Maturity.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It hath a potent tendency to obviate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſuch Pre-ingagements as would be obſtructive and prejudicial to their imbracement of the Covenant. And here we may obſerve, that they are liable to be pre-ingaged three ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In ways of Idolatry. Secondly, In a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the good things of the World. Thirdly, In ways of moral Impieties and Debauchries. Now
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106622:107"/>to be pre-ingaged, eſpecially fixed in any of theſe ways, muſt needs be greatly obſtructive and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to their imbracement of the Covenant that God hath eſtabliſhed between himſelf and his People. What ways and courſes Men ingage, at leaſt are fixed in from their Child-hood, they are not eaſily brought to relinquiſh: <hi>Hath a Nation changed their God?</hi> Jer. 2.11. That God in whoſe worſhip and ſervice Men have been ingaged from their youth, they will not eaſily change: So to be ingaged and accuſtomed to atheiſtical, irreligious and profane ways and courſes from their youth, is not a little obſtructive and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their imbracement of the Covenant: <hi>Can the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>change his skin, or the</hi> Leopard <hi>his ſpots? then may you alſo do good who are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi> Jer. 13.23. And the like is true of Childrens being early ingaged in the purſuance of the World, and the things thereof. To ſhew the various ways, how to be pre-ingaged in any of theſe ways from a Man's Child-hood, obſtructs and oppoſeth his imbracement of the Covenant and giving up himſelf to God in Chriſt in a Covenant-way, is a matter of no great difficulty, but would be ſomewhat excentrical to my preſent purpoſe: But this I ſay, how obſtructive and prejudicial ſoever ſuch an ingagement, eſpecially fixing in any of theſe ways from Mens Child-hood, would be to their imbracement of the Covenant; (and ingage they will in one or the other of them, and that early too, unleſs the free Grace of God bleſſing the means ſubſerving their taking hold of the Covenant prevent) yet the Application of the Token of the Covenant to Infants hath a potent tendency to prevent any ſuch pre-ingagements they are liable to: For let us but take a brief veiw of the original ſprings or cauſes whence
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106622:107"/>Mens ſo early ingaging in one or another of the ways and courſes mentioned doth proceed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It proceeds from certain natural and imbred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Deity ingraven upon the minds of all Men; at leaſt from a natural diſpoſedneſs of the faculties of the rational Soul to comply with that notion when ſuggeſted from without.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From a ſenſe and feeling of ſelf-emptineſs and inſufficiency as to that Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs they ſoon perceive themſelves capable of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the inapprehenſiveneſs and inſenſibleneſs of any cogent obligation to the contrary. Man from his very Childhood is prone to look upon and exalt himſelf as God, to ſay of his whole ſelf, as thoſe in the Pſalm of their tongues, I am mine own, <hi>who is Lord over me?</hi> And according to various circumſtances that Children fall under, ſo from this threefold ſpring they ingage in one or another of the ways mentioned. But now the bringing them under the bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ingaging them to the true God in Chriſt by the Application of the Token to them, hath a potent tendency to obviate and prevent their ingaging or fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any of theſe ways. Let us ſee it in ſome Inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The true God is firſt preſented to their minds. Now it's uſual for Man, as through the fall become not only dark, but darkneſs it ſelf, and conſequently as having loſt the knowledge of the true God, to comply and fall in with, and chuſe that God to himſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true, or any falſe God that is firſt preſented to his mind, or that is firſt propoſed to him under the notion of a Deity. Hence it is, that the ſame God is imbraced and worſhipped as their God by ſeveral Nations ſucceſſively from one Generation to another: <hi>Hath a Nation changed their God?</hi> It is not often
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106622:108"/>found that they have. Children uſually fall in with and worſhip that God their Parents have done, and from hence it is, that the true God is owned and worſhipped ſucceſſively from one Generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Nations and Places where the Scriptures are received, and the Chriſtian Doctrine imbraced. They own and worſhip him, not as being convinced that he is indeed the true God by rational demonſtrations, much leſs as being ſavingly taught and inlightned by himſelf; but he is that God that is firſt preſented to their minds, and that they firſt apprehend under the notion of a Deity: and this, though it is true, through the ſubtilty of Satan, and corruption in the hearts of Men, too often is utterly uſeleſs to them in order to their eternal Happineſs; yet in it ſelf hath a ſingular ſubſerviency thereunto, and would be of no ſmall advantage to Men, were it well improved. Yet further, the true God is not only firſt preſented to the minds of the Seed of Believers, but he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their minds as ſtanding in a Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards them, and conſequently they find themſelves in a Covenant-relation with him (for Covenant-relations are always mutual.) Hence as they find him obliged by Covenant to be theirs: ſo themſelves obliged to be his; which muſt needs have a potent tendency, as to check any Inquiries that they would otherwiſe be prone to make af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo to keep them from attending to any propoſals that might be made by others of any falſe god, and alſo from the choice of any falſe god by themſelves. To have the true God firſt preſented to the mind is of no ſmall advantage to prevent Mens inquiring after, and attending to the propoſal of any falſe god to them; eſpecially conſidering the ſuiteableneſs of thoſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106622:108"/>God hath made of himſelf in his Word (and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed therein he is ſuppoſed to be preſented to their minds) to thoſe notions of a God in the general, that are either found ingraven upon the minds of Men as born into the World, or are taken up by the free uſe of the rational powers and faculties of the Soul. Now for Children ſo ſoon as capable of reflecting upon themſelves, and acting rationally with reference to their own future welfare and welbeing, to find an antecedent mutual relation between this God and themſelves, wherein he ſtands related to them as their God, and they ſtand related to him as his People, Subjects and Servants, will add greatly to the more effectual prevention of their ingaging in any ways of Idolatry they (as Youth is) are prone to comply and fall in with that God that is firſt preſented to the mind, or that the mind hath the firſt notice of: ſo the notion under which the true God is preſented to their minds ſuiting ſo well with thoſe antecedent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they have of a God in the general, will greatly conduce to their compliance and falling in with him and his worſhip and ſervice: But when they find a mutual relation already eſtabliſhed between him and them, that will yet further their compliance; and conſequently their inquiries after, or attendance to what may be propoſed or offered to them concerning any other God, will be obviated and prevented. And though this may ſeem of ſmall importance to Children born in Places and Nations where the true God is only owned worſhipped and ſerved, there being no danger of their firſt ingaging in any ways of Idolatry in ſuch Places and Nations: yet we muſt remember, that God in the eſtabliſhment of his Covenant had reſpect to his People and their Seed, not only as inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106622:109"/>ſuch Places and Nations, but as inhabiting Places and Nations where falſe gods are owned, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and ſerved. 2. God's being under an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to communicate himſelf to, and act for their good according to the tenour of the Covenant, will give them aſſurance of a fulneſs of Bleſſedneſs and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their alone cleaving to, worſhipping and ſerving him; whence they may be eaſily convinced of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarineſs of either applying themſelves to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any falſe god, or to the World, or any ways of ſenſuality for the gaining that Happineſs they find themſelves capable of, but inſufficient unto as of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Man, ſo ſoon as capable of reflecting upon himſelf, or taking any account of his own caſe and condition, finds himſelf utterly deſtitute of a ſelf-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, ſees himſelf capable of more good than he is furniſhed with, and ſubject to variety of evils, which of himſelf without ſome extrinſecal aid he cannot ſecure himſelf from, nor deliver himſelf out of: hence he is forced to look without, and caſt about him to find out which way, or from whence he may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with that good he finds himſelf defective in, and delivered out of, or ſecured from that evil he finds himſelf under or ſubject to: and according to various circumſtances that Men are under, ſo they betake themſelves to, and ingage in various ways and courſes, yet with reference to the ſame general end, <hi>viz.</hi> the gaining of Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs. Now Children, if left to the mere conduct of nature as now corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will certainly and unavoidably betake themſelves to one or other of the aforementioned ways, which muſt needs be greatly obſtructive and prejudicial to their imbracement of the Covenant of Grace. But now for the Seed of Believers to find God under ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106622:109"/>obligation to communicate himſelf to, and act for their good, as he hath put himſelf under towards them muſt needs have a powerful tendency to obviate and prevent their ingaging in any ſuch way; becauſe they will find their Happineſs &amp; Bleſſedneſs fully ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that obligation, ſuppoſing them not to reject, but actually to own the Covenant eſtabliſhed with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Covenant under the bond of which they already are, ſtrongly obligeth them againſt applying themſelves to, or ingaging in any of the ways men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; But of this more hereafter. So that we may ſee how great a tendency the Application of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of Believers, upon a precedent Intereſt they have in the Covenant it ſelf, hath to the obviating and preventing their ingaging or fixing in any ways obſtructive and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their imbracing of the Covenant as they grow up to years of Maturity; thoſe ways they are naturally prone to ingage in (their ingagement in which would oppoſe their imbracing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) are hedged up. When God hedgeth up the way of his People after their Lovers, then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon returning to and ſeeking him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. So for Children to have their ingaging in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ways obviated and prevented, highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to their taking hold of the Covenant, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying themſelves to the worſhip and ſervice of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Covenant-relation, wherein the Seed of Believers ſtands Godwards, as ſolemnized, ratified and confirmed by the Application of the Token, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves their perſonal imbracement, and taking hold of the Covenant, and anſwerably giving up themſelves to God in Chriſt according to the tenour of it by way of obligation: they hereby become under the ſtrongeſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106622:110"/>obligation to do it; and we may obſerve a fourfold obligation that they are under, beyond what the Children of others are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, There is all that Love, Grace and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God expreſt in the extending the Covenant with the Sign and Token thereof unto them, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them all the Good aforementioned, as an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them. As this Grace, Love, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is a powerful ingagement to Parents to endeavour the converſion of their Children, and bring them to a perſonal imbracement of the Covenant; ſo it is alike powerful ingagement to Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to imbrace it, and give up themſelves to the worſhip and ſervice of God according to the tenour of it. How great Grace, Love and Goodneſs God hath expreſt to the Seed of Believers in his extending his Covenant unto them with the Token thereof, hath been already declared. Now when they become ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of underſtanding, and reflecting upon that Love, Grace and Goodneſs, the apprehenſion and conſideration of it hath a potent tendency to excite their love to, and ingage them to take this God for their God, and to worſhip and ſerve him. Love hath a conſtraining power, and Children are capable of receiving early impreſſions from their apprehenſions of what Grace and Love is expreſt towards them as well as grown perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is their Parents acceptation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for them, and their entring them into it, and giving them up to God according to the tenour of it, as another obligation upon them. Parents acts on the behalf of, or with reference to their Children, are an obligation upon them to comply with, and ſtand to what is done by their Parents on their behalf, and with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106622:110"/>reference to them. Hence <hi>Samuel</hi> complyes with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's</hi> vow, and gives himſelf freely to ſerve the Lord in his Tabernacle, according to the dedication ſhe had made of him. Yea <hi>Jepthah's</hi> daughter complies with her Father's vow, though (as moſt think) it was to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in Sacrifice: <hi>My Father (ſaith ſhe) if thou haſt opened thy mouth to the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth,</hi> Judg. 11.36. As Parents have a power to diſpoſe of their Children in a ſubordination unto God: ſo Children are obliged to comply with that diſpoſal they make of them. And as the confidence Nature it ſelf reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to have in their Parents as to their prudence, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo their duty towards them obligeth them ſo to do. Hence their Parents having accepted of the Covenant for them, and anſwerably entred them into it, they are under a powerful obligation to comply with what their Parents have done, and anſwerably perſonally imbrace the Covenant, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God in Chriſt to worſhip and ſerve him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the Token of the Covenant as applyed to, and born by them, as a further obligation upon them. One uſe and end of the Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whether Circumciſion or Baptiſm, according to divine Inſtitution, was, and is to oblige and ingate the Perſons to whom it was and is applied to cleave and adhere to God in Chriſt, his worſhip and ſervice. The Token of the Covenant is equivalent to Preſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given to Souldiers: God by it obligeth his People to himſelf, and to ſerve under Chriſt the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their Salvation: From this uſe or end of the Token or Seals of the Covenant, they ſeem to have received their denomination of Sacraments; which word is conceived to be borrowed from the ancient
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106622:111"/>
                  <hi>Romans,</hi> among whom it was uſed to ſignifie the oath by which, together with certain rights and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript form of words, Souldiers did ingage themſelves, or were ingaged to do whatſoever the Emperour or General ſhould command, and not forſake their Colours till the Wars were ended. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is ſuppoſed to be the firſt that brought the word into the Church, and applied it to a ſpiritual uſe. But however the Word is not improper nor unfit, it fully expreſſing this end and uſe of the Tokens of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they were, and are for the ingaging men to God in Chriſt. God by them ingageth and ties his People to himſelf. Now the Seed of Believers when they come to years of Maturity finding themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this bond, and that as put upon them by Divine Inſtitution, muſt needs be more ſtrongly obliged to take God in Chriſt as their God, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, to be his, to worſhip and ſerve him according to the tenour of the Covenant. God's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preſſed them (as I may ſo ſpeak) into his own ſervice, and obliged them to himſelf by ſuch a ſolemn right, is a ſtrong obligation upon them to ſerve him; and give themſelves to him. Hence we read of the Martyr, who to all his temptations to deny Chriſt makes no reply but this, <hi>Baptizatus ſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There is the great aggravation that their ſin in rojecting the Covenant they had, as the Seed of ſuch Parents, admiſſion into, and forſaking God and his ways, above that the ſin of others in neglecting to take hold of the Covenant doth admit of; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the greatneſs of their condemnation above the condemnation of others in caſe they ſhould ſo do, as a further obligation upon them to imbrace the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanant, and walk in the ways of God they are afore-obliged
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106622:111"/>to. Their ſin in rejecting the Covenant into which they were taken admits of variety of aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, beyond what the ſin of others in not taking hold of the Covenant admits of, which they being made ſenſible the apprehonſive of, hath a potent tendency ſtrongly to oblige them to imbrace it. But of this I may touch more again hereafter. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. And laſtly, The intereſt that the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have in the Covenant as ratified, ſealed and confirmed to them by the Application of the Token, highly ſubſerves their perſonal imbracement of it by way of incouragement; they have peculiar incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements thereunto beyond what others have. To inſtance in ſome few of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, They find themſelves already in a ſtate of peace with God. Their work is not ſo much to gain, or make peace with God, as to maintain it. Their peace is already made by being received into the Covenant of Grace, the Law hath nothing to charge upon them to their condemnation, they are not under the Law but under Grace; they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the condemning power of whatever guilt might hitherto be charged upon them. And how great an incouragement muſt that needs be to them to cloſe in with Chriſt? what ground of hope have they that God will accept of them and grant them his Spirit for their Renovation and Sanctification? 'Tis none of the leaſt diſcouragements to Adult ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to come unto Chriſt, that they ly under ſo much guilt as they are conſcious to themſelves of: were they aſſured their guilt were removed, that God were not obliged to deal with them as enemies, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and what hopes would they have, that God might give them his Spirit for their Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106622:112"/>and Sanctification. Now that diſcouragement is removed out of the way of the Seed of Believers, finding themſelves already in a ſtate of peace with God; how can they then rationally entertain any jealouſies about his readineſs to do them good, and continue them in that ſtate?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the mutual Love and Friendſhip that hath been between God and theri Parents as a further incouragement to them. The ſpecial Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that God bears to their Parents, is a choiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Children, that, accepting of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and giving up themſelves to God in Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of it, they ſhall not be rejected, but readily accepted by him. As God hath granted and actually vouchſafed many choice Mercies and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to Children for their Parents ſake: ſo Children have improved the conſideration of their relation to ſuch Parents as a help to their Faith and Hope in their ſeeking unto God for Mercy. Thus, though <hi>Iſhmael</hi> by his perſecuting of <hi>Iſaac</hi> had forfeited his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant, and was caſt out both of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family and the Covenant; yet God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to make him a Nation, becauſe he was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.13. So we find God for the ſake both of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſhewing Mercy to their reſpective Poſterity, though guilty of great provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt him, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 105.42. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.35. Hence are ſuch Petitions in Scritpture, <hi>Oh turn unto me, and have Mercy upon me, give thy ſtrength to they Servant, and ſave the Son of thy Hand-maid,</hi> Pſal. 86.16. As the conſideration of his own relation to God as his Servant, ſo the conſideration of his delcent from her that was his Hand-maid, was a great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to him, and a great advantage to his Faith
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106622:112"/>and Hope in petitioning for Mercy. For Children to conſider their relation to ſuch Parents, between God and whom there hath been or is a mutual ſpecial Love and Friendſhip, is a ſingular incouragement to them in taking hold of the Covenant, and applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God for the Mercies and Bleſſings of it. The Love that God bears to believing Parents is a very great ingagement to him to a ready doing Good to their Children.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is all that God hath already done for them as the Seed of ſuch Parents ſignally expreſſive and ſignificative of his ſpecial good will towards them, as a further incouragement to them God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Covenant to them, and thereby freeing them from the condemning power of Original ſin, giving them an intereſt in himſelf, and a right to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Salvation, and thereby ſecuring their Salvation in caſe of their death in Infancy, are glorious ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of his ſpecial good will unto them, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs that they in particular ſhould be ſaved, and conſequently may be improved as choice incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them to take hold of the Covenant: They have not the leaſt ground to ſuſpect God's readineſs to receive them, and proceed on in his goodneſs and kindneſs to them, ſeeing he hath ſecured their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his Covenant and Promiſe, while they were uncapable of performing the conditions of it in their own Perſons, be ſure he will not reject them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to continue hs Grace to them, in order to their future Salvation, when they are willing to accept of and perform the conditions of the Covenant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtrengtheneth his Faith and Hope as to God's <hi>delivering him from every evil work, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him to his Heavenly Kingdom</hi> by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106622:113"/>of what he had done for him in delivering him from that great Tyrant <hi>Nero,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.16, 17, 18. And ſurely much more may the Seed of Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves and ſtrengthen their Faith and Hope as to God's acceptation of them, and giving them Grace and Glory, themſelves being now wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of and perform the conditions of the Covenant by the conſideration of what he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done for them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They may, if not poſitively aſſure themſelves, yet comfortably hope that they are yet actually under the Promiſes of God's being a God to them, and giving them future Salvation; And how great an incouragement muſt that needs be to them? They have the faithfulneſs of God ingaged to make good his Promiſes, unleſs they by their wilful rejection of Chriſt and the Terms of the Covenant forſeit their own Intereſt in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be ſaid, Though hitherto they have been actually under the Promiſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might have incouraged themſelves by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the faithfulneſs of God: but now they can no longer lay claim to the Promiſes, but upon ſuppoſition of their own performance of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, but yet let this be conſidered, That God in the Promiſe ſpeaks more determinately, expreſsly and particularly to them, than he doth to others. The language of God to each one of them is this, I am thy God, only do not now reject my Covenant, and the relation between me and thee ſhall be continued. To others he ſpeaks more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and indefinitely, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved. Him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106622:113"/>Whoſoever will, let him come and take of the Water of Life.</hi> Now, though it is true, theſe general and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite Promiſes and Invitations are ſufficient incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to all to come unto and cloſe in with Chriſt, and caſt themſelves upon him for Pardon, Life and Salvation; yet we find by experience, poor awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinners are hardly perſwaded that themſelves are in particular intended in thoſe more general and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Promiſes and Calls. Were they aſſured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were intended, it would be a mighty incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them; but that they are hardly brought to believe. The more we can appropriate any Promiſes to our ſelves in particular, the greater efficacy they will have upon our hearts for our incouragement. It is a mighty incouragement to the Jaylor, when the Apoſtle ſhall ſpeak particularly to him, and aſſure him <hi>if he ſhould believe, he ſhould be ſaved and all his houſe.</hi> Now God ſpeaks particularly and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to the Seed of Believers, and not only offers to be a God to them, but aſſures them he is ſo already, only requires their perſonal performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant, in order to the continuance of that Relation between himſelf and them, and that they may have the actual injoyment of that Salvation, they are, as the Seed of ſuch Parents, the Heirs of. And if it ſhould be ſaid, that they may have forfeited their Covenant-ſtate and Relation already by their not ſooner actually and explicitly recognizing the Covenant, and giving up themſelvs to God in Chriſt according to the tenour of it; and fears of that will render this conſideration of little uſe to them. That Objection ſhall be anſwered by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be yet ſaid, That what incouragements ſoever they have to believe and take hold of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106622:114"/>yet they will ſoon find by experience their own inability to do it, they will find they cannot do it without the ſpecial Teachings and Operations of the Spirit; and what incouragement have they to hope for theſe Teachings and Operations beyond what others have? To that I add in a fifth incouragement that they have above others, and that is this: They ſtand nearer than the reſt of Mankind to, and are the more eſpecial Objects of the Promiſes of ſaving Grace. This I have ſpoken ſo largely to already, that I need add no more. But beſides, all thoſe other incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements they have to believe may be improved as a help to their hope for Grace to inable them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Surely then finding themſelves in a ſtate of Peace with God, remembring what a mutual Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Love there hath been between God and their Parents, conſidering what he hath already done for them as a ſignal ſignification of his good will towards them, and having a particular Promiſe to aſſure them in particular, that as God at preſent is, ſo he will continue to be a God to them, unleſs by their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary rejecting the Covenant they diſanul that their Intereſt; may not only be choice incouragements to them to believe and take hold of the Covenant, but to hope that God will readily vouchſafe them the Teachings and effectual Operations of his Spirit to inable them ſo to do, they waiting upon him in his own way. But to put a cloſe to this ſecond Queſtion. We now ſee how great Good, what glorious Benefits and Advantages the Seed of Believers have by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Token of the Covenant to them; and from all we may conclude, that Infant-Baptiſm is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice well worthy enquiring into, and contending for by all Parents that have any reſpect to the ſpiritual and eternal welfare of their Children.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This and the next Queſtion being frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and largely treated of by others, I ſhall ſpeak the more ſparingly to them. For this Queſtion then, the duty of Parents is conſiderable two ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Firſt, As to be performed immediately, and directly towards their Children.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, As to be performed more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards God, but with reference to, and on the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106622:115"/>behalf of their Children, they are to deal with their Children in the Name, and on the behalf of God, and to deal with God, with reference to, and on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their Children.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, For their duty immediately and directly reſpecting their Children, the Apoſtle ſummarily comprehends it under theſe two terms, <hi>Nurture and Admonition,</hi> and both muſt be <hi>of the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6.3. <hi>And ye Fathers provoke not your Children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> Though the Apoſtle here ſpeaks expreſsly only unto Fathers, yet Mothers are not exempted, but included: As they are alike intereſted in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with their Husbands; ſo they are to joyn with them in the holy education of them; and ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>bring up your Children in</hi> or with <hi>the nurture and admonition of the Lord;</hi> as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, to your ſeeding, cloathing and providing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for their bodies, and a comfortable ſubſiſtance in this life, add the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall do two things. 1. Briefly open their duty. 2. Add ſome Rules for a more ſucceſsful performance of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt, under theſe two terms, we are to comprehend two things in the general.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, Inſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, The Uſe and Application of all due and apt means ſubſerving or conducing to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, acting and practiſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to inſtructions given them:<note n="*" place="margin">Hortatur ut eos educent cum inſtitutione &amp; commonefactione Domini, hoc eſt, ut eos inſtituant, &amp; erudiant in Doctrinâ Chriſtianâ, &amp; ſubinde piis commonefactionibus ad officia pietatis forment. <hi>Piſca.</hi> in loco.</note> ſo that the duty of Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106622:115"/>their Children conſiſts in two things in the general.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In teaching and inſtructing them. And though they are to teach and inſtruct them in their whole duty both towards God and Man; yet I ſhall only inſtance in five things, wherein they are in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner to inſtruct them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, They are to teach and inſtruct them in the knowledge of God, acquaint them with the Being of God, endeavour to convince them that there is a ſupreme Being whom we call God, who is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Governour of all things, from whom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have originally received their Beings, whoſe they are, and upon whom they depend, whom they muſt worſhip, and who will judge them at the laſt day, and then reward them according as they have obeyed or diſobeyed his Commands. And as they are to inſtruct them in the Being of a God; ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the manner of his Subſtence and Nature, as revealed by his Names, Titles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, as they are able to bear it. And we find Children ſoon comply with the notions of a Deity, and not altogether unreadily entertain eſpecially ſuch notions of and about his Nature, as are diſcoverable by, and agreeable to the light and dictates of Nature. Some have obſerved, that all Religion is ingraffed upon the ſtock of Nature; God hath left ſomewhat of thoſe Original Principles of Religion implanted in the Nature of Man at his firſt Creation, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitates the reception of the firſt fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon which all Religion is built; as a brand ſooner inkindles than the green wood that hath never been in the fire. Hence Parents are to begin with the revival of ſuch principles and Notions as are not
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106622:116"/>utterly obliterated and blotted out of the Nature of Man, and ſuch are theſe concerning the Beeing of God, his Nature and Relations towards Man as his Creator and Governour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let but theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Notions be throughly revived, and more fully fixed and reveted in the minds and Conſciences of Children; it will greatly facilitate their reception of all higher Truths and Doctrines revealed in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are to teach and inſtruct them in the way of God's dealing with Man as his Creature, that it always hath been and ſtill is according to ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherein he promiſes ſomewhat of Good unto Men upon condition of their performing that duty himſelf hath preſcribed and injoyned; having always annexed rewards and puniſhments to the performance or non-performance of that duty. For Parents to inſtruct their Children and make them apprehenſive and ſenſible that this always hath been, and ſtill is the way of God's dealing with Men, will greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their more ready entertainment of what ſhall be ſhewed them concerning the ſeveral Covenants God hath made with Men, and their ſtates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and duties as intereſted in the one or the other Covenant that God hath made with Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are to teach and inſtruct them in and about the Covenant of Nature, or the Law of Works eſtabliſhed with Man at his firſt Creation; and here they are to inſtruct them, in that happy eſtate Man was in as under that Covenant, how happy he ſhould have been had he performed the conditions of it; what penalty was annexed to the tranſgreſſion of that Law; how that Covenant was broken by <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Parent of Mankind; how far all his poſterity are
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106622:116"/>concerned in that breach; what the penalty is that all Mankind as born into the World are under, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject to, as involved in that breach; how the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin redounds to them; how their Natures are corruped and depraved; how that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and depravation of their Natures flows from that firſt breach of that Covenant; how they are Children of Wrath, as under that guilt, and as having their Natures ſo vitiated and depraved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They are to inſtruct them, in and about the Covenant of Grace, as eſtabliſhed in the Sacrifice, Death and Sufferings of a Mediator; and here they are to inſtruct them, in the Perſon, Offices and Works of this Mediator; what are the terms and conditions of this Covenant; how far themſelves are intereſted in it, as the Seed of believing Parents; what Good they have already granted to them by it; upon what terms that Good was granted, and hath been hitherto continued to them; what is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them to the preſervation of their Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They are to teach and inſtruct them in the uſes and ends of their Baptiſm;<note n="*" place="margin">Doctrinam Baptiſmi teneant Baptizati. <hi>Hild.</hi>
                  </note> what is ſignified by it; how the Covenant they are received into, is ſealed and confirmed by it; what aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance they have thereby of injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Good, Benefits and Bleſſings promiſed, unleſs they forfeit them by the non-performance of that duty God requires on their parts; what incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements they have to perform that duty; what obligations ly upon them to take hold of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and give up themſelves to God; what their ſin and miſery will be in caſe they do it not; how
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106622:117"/>happy they ſhall be in caſe they do it. Thus the Lord commands the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to inſtruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the uſe and ends of the Paſsover, and the ſame they were doubtleſs to do in reſpect of Circumciſion, and other Sacramental ſings in uſe among them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, when your Children ſay unto you, What mean you by this ſervice? then ye ſhall ſay, It is the Sacrifice of the Lord's Paſsover, who paſſed over the houſes of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, when he ſmote the Egyptians, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our houſes.</hi> And here we may obſerve the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of bringing Children to the adminiſtration of Baptiſm: to others it may occaſion their enquiry after the meaning of that Ordinance; but however, whether they enquire or no, it is the duty of Parents to let them behold the adminiſtration of it, and thereupon take occaſion to inſtruct them in the uſes and ends of it. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Uſe and Application of all due and apt means conducing to their imbracing, acting and practiſing according to theſe inſtructions given them. And thus</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are to keep them, as much as may be, from any notice or knowledge of any Objects, Principles, or Doctrines, as alſo from any ſuch notions, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of, and about earthly things, as by means whereof, they may be obſtructed and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced in their cloſing in with God in Chriſt, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Covenant, and giving themſelves up to God according to the terms of it.</p>
               <p>Preſerve their minds and affections, as much as may be, from anticipations or pre-ingagements, by means of which their imbracing, acting and practiſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they are taught, would be prejudiced.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:106622:117"/>
               <p>Thus, ſuppoſe Believers to have their lot caſt in places where ſome falſe God is worſhipped, their duty would be, to keep their Children from any notice of ſuch a God: ſo where corrupt Principles and Doctrines, whether relating to worſhip or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are preached or maintained, it is the duty of Parents, what in them lyes, to keep their Children from any knowledge of them, leſt their minds and judgments ſhould be infected with them; So to keep them from the ſight of ſuch things as have a tendency to vitiate their minds, and excite the corruptions of their hearts. For this reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us a Law-giver <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt the minds of youth ſhould be vitiated, and they ſhould firſt learn to ſpeak filthily, and then to act filthily. So again, to keep them from any ſuch notions or apprehenſions of, and about earthly things, as tend to ingage their affections to them. Parents are not a little prejudicial to their Children, to appland their bravery, on the account of fine clothes and the like: ſo by inſinuating the worth and excellency of Mony, Eſtates, Honours and the like; they ſhould rather endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the nothingneſs, inſignificancy and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of theſe things. When Childrens minds are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with notions and apprehenſions of a worth and excellency in ſuch things, their deſires run out after them, and they begin to promiſe to themſelves a kind of felicity in them; whence they ſoon ingage in a purſuance of them, to the neglect of Chriſt, and that inheritance above they are born Heirs unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Frequent repetitions and inculcations of the ſame things greatly conduce to the ends mentioned: Children, as they receive but little at a time, ſo they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106622:118"/>need frequent repetitions and inculacations of the ſame things; their underſtandings are weak, their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſlippery, and what impreſſions may be made upon their hearts and affections, ſoon wear off again: hence the ſame things muſt be often repeated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated upon them. Indeed repetitions and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the ſame things are uſeful to the Adult: <hi>To write the ſame things to you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Philippians, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is ſafe,</hi> Phil. 3.1. Men it is true are deſighted in variety, and in the newneſs of things propoſed, but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to write the ſame things is ſafe for you:</hi> yet the ſame things may be written, or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in variety of phraſes and different expreſſions, and ſo to do, is uſeful to prevent tediouſneſs, and loathing; but to have the ſame things frequently repeated and inculcated, if not in the ſame, yet in different phraſes and expreſſions, is exceeding ſafe for grown Chriſtians, and much more for Children; yea to repeat the ſame things, in the ſame words and expreſſions, ſuppoſing purdence be uſed, is uſeful for them. The Lord, ſpeaking of the Commandments, Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had given his ancient People, gives them this charge about them, that <hi>they ſhould teach them diligently to their Children,</hi> Deut. 6.7. and what he means by teaching them diligently, he explains in the following words, <hi>thou ſhalt talk of them</hi> (viz. to thy Children) <hi>when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up;</hi> as much as to ſay, thou ſhalt be frequently talking of, and inculcating them upon thy Children. The capacities of Children require a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent repetition and inculcation of the ſame things, as in reſpect of their natural ſood: As they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:106622:118"/>and digeſt but a little at a time, ſo they muſt be frequently fed: So in reſpect of inſtructions, which are the food of their ſouls, they muſt be frequently inſtructed in the ſame things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The intermingling Exhortations, Perſwaſions, Intreaties, Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Inſtructions, tends greatly to render thoſe Inſtructions more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual; it is not enough to inlighten the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and inform the judgment, but the affections and paſſions muſt be wrought upon, and excited. We find the working upon, and exciting of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and paſſions in grown perſons is highly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their converſion, imbracement of, and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs in the ways of God; and much more muſt it be ſo in Children. Now the aflections and paſſions are wrought upon by the means now mentioned. Theſe Exhortations, Perſwaſions, Commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are conceived to be included in this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we tranſlate admonition; Parents are to bring up up their Children in the admonition as well as nurture of the Lord: ſo ſaith God of <hi>Abraham, I know</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>that he will command his Children and his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;</hi> and what the iſſue of that ſhall be he tells us, <hi>they ſhall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 18.19. of which more by and by. Such Perſwaſions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, Intreaties and Commands are expreſſive of the affections of Parents towards, as well as their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their Children; and the more Children are ſenſible of their Parents affection towards, and authority over them, the greater efficacy will their Inſtructions have upon their hearts. Their Parents are preſent with them, and viſible to them; God is out of their ſight, their apprehenſions of him can be ſuppoſed to be but low, and confuſed; they live by
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106622:119"/>ſence, and not by Faith. Hence an affectionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, or Intreaty from their Parents, may, and poſſibly will do more with them, than the bare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God; however ſuch Exhortations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from their Parents added to the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Commands from God in his Word, muſt needs rationally be more effectual. There is their Parents affection anſwered by a natural ſtorge and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial affection towards them, and Paternal authority anſwered by a natural kind of inſtinct, or inclination to obey, ſuperadded to the efficacy of thoſe dawnings of Light, let into their underſtandings by Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given them, and of thoſe morning-apprehenſions they have of God, more effectually to induce and ingage them to act and practiſe accordingly. Hence this intermixture of Exhortations, Perſwaſions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties and Commands muſt needs greatly further their converſion and imbracement of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Good Examples are great furtherances to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens falling in with, and imbracement of the ways of God; and indeed neither inſtructions, nor the uſe of any other means can be rationally expected to be ſucceſsful, without this example conduce to the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Inſtructions effectual two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They reallize to Childrens apprehenſions the things they are inſtructed in, and about: for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to ſpeak of a God infinitely holy, and a perfect hater of ſin; to ſpeak of God infinitely juſt, and a ſevere avenger of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet not expreſs any fear towards him themſelves, nor take heed of what is ſinful, will ſignify little; Children will quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the inconſiſtency between what is ſpoken of, or concerning God, and their Parents ways and actions. Now how can Parents expect their Children
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106622:119"/>ſhould believe, what their own ways and actions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves believe not?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Examplies induce and provoke to Imitation, <hi>Exempla magis movent quàm documenta,</hi> is peculiarly true, as applyed to Children; we ſee how prone they are to Imitation, their manners are much formed by example;<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have youth kept even from the ſight of all Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of any Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, excepting of ſuch an one who <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, repreſents the honeſt manners of worthy Men.</note> hence good examples not only from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but others highly further their falling in with, and imbracing of the ways of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To put Children upon and inure them to holy exerciſes, will greatly further the ends aimed at: hence Parents ſhould put their Children upon the practice of what they have taught them, thus they are to cauſe them to joyn in holy duties both publick and private.</p>
               <p>It is prejudicial to Children to be excluded from Family duties, at leaſt when they are capable to joyn in them, without cauſing diſtractions; and let me ſay for Parents to plead Children will be troubleſome, when the fault is in themſelves, in not bringing of them under their command, will be but a bad excuſe at the laſt.</p>
               <p>So again, Parents ſhould inure them to holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes themſelves, as Reading and Praying, and direct them in a right performance of that duty: we find both our Lord Chriſt, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> inſtructed their Diſciples in performance of that duty, and probably betimes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.1. Let them know that all Good muſt come from God, and put them upon
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106622:120"/>the ſeeking for it from him; let them know their continuance in a Covenant-ſtate depends upon their performance of the conditions themſelves, but let them know withall that it is God muſt give what himſelf requires.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The adding of due Correction as the caſe may require, will yet promote the ſame ends; the Rod is the Child's ordinance, hence ſo frequently recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Solomon.</hi> Though correction conveys not Grace to, nor can it work Grace in the ſoul, yet it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſerves their gaining of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, Let me juſt touch upon ſome few Rules, that may be of uſe unto Parents in their right and ſucceſsful performance of their duty towards their Children.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By grave and ſerious dealing with them about the concerns of God and their ſouls, with a gravity and ſeriouſneſs becoming matters of ſuch an importance. It is ſaid of a Biſhop, he muſt be one who <hi>ruleth well his own houſe, having his Children in ſubjection with all gravity,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.4. the ſame is the duty of all Chriſtian Parents, though eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required in the Miniſters of the Goſpel. Some deal with their Children in ſoul-affaires, as though they were rather in jeſt than earneſt; and no wonder though Children are neither ſerious, nor in good earneſt in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ending to, or practiſing ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Parents ſhould labour to carry it ſo in all their words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as that their Children may perceive the weight and importance of the things they deal with them about.</p>
               <p>Inſtructing and chaſtiſing Children requires the utmoſt gravity and ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:106622:120"/>2. Shew as much love to God, as alſo as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards your Children, but as little of ſelf and paſſion as poſſibly you can: the more Children are apprehenſive of theſe things (and quickly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive they will be) the more weight will inſtructions have upon their hearts; the leſs of God, and the more of ſelf appears in any Inſtructions, Counſels, Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Commands, the leſs will they be attended to, and regarded, <hi>ſic vice verſâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Exerciſe Wiſdom and Prudence. Wiſdom and Prudence is required hardly in any thing, if in any thing at all, more than in the education and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Children; yet I ſhall not attempt to give any Reles in this caſe, neither is it in the power of any man to give ſuch Rules and Directions, as may ſufficiently furniſh all Parents with that Wiſdom and Prudence neceſſary to the right managing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the diſcharge of their duty towards their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; they muſt have it from God, or after all, they will be greatly defective therein. I ſhall only intimate ſome Caſes wherein ſpecial Wiſdom is requried.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In beginning with ſuch Inſtructions as thoſe principles connatural to them will ſubſerve their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement of, to kindle the brand, if I may ſo ſpeak, where it hath the greateſt diſpoſition to take fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, Wiſdom is required in ſo repeatîng and inculcating Inſtructions, as that they may be moſt uſeful for the inlightning their minds, and working upon their affections; and yet may not beget tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſlightneſs of ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, much Wiſdom is required in interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſuch inſtructions; and ſo adminiſtring them, as may keep up their love to, and delight in Religion,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:106622:121"/>with ſuch inſtructions as may keep up a holy awe and fear in their hearts Godward.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, Wiſdom is required in keeping up their incouragements, and yet preventing their preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and formality.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Once again, much Wiſdom is required in deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Children according to their different tempers and conſtitutions; ſome are more eaſily wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by love, others by fear; ſome by gentle, others by more ſevere means; ſome need more of the rod, others leſs: and variety of the like inſtances might be given. This is certain, the ſucceſs of Parents diſcharge of their duty towards their Children, very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Wiſdom they are indued with, and do exerciſe therein.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Begin with your Children betimes, <hi>Chaſten thy Child betimes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſo inſtruct him betimes. Parents ſhould endeavour (were it poſſible) to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate Satan, and put a check to the very firſt buddings forth of corruption, <hi>Quò ſemel eſt imbuta recens,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis the folly of moſt Parents to leave themſeles only an after-game to play; they ſow not till the thorns have got ſuch rooting, as that they check the ſeed ſowen; their Childrens minds are ſo vitiated, that their in ſtructions meet with ſtronger oppoſition than otherwiſe they would do: therefore begin with them betimes, <hi>In the morning ſow they ſeed.</hi> 'Tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to our preſent purpoſe, Children have ears to hear before they have tongues to ſpeak. That may be received by the ear and eye which the tongue cannot expreſs; hence Parents ſhould not forbear inſtructions till their Children are capable of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwers. But</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:106622:121"/>2. The duty of Parents more immediately reſpects God, yet to be performed on the behalf of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thus their great duty is Prayer; and two things in the general they are to pray for:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The beſtowment of ſuch endownents upon themſelves, as may capacifie them for the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance fo their duty towards their Children. And of all gifts and endowments they ought to be peculiarly importunate for Wiſdom and Prudence. He that gives wiſdom to the Husband-man for the <hi>caſting in the Fetches and ſcattering the Cummin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>when he hath plowed his ground and made plain the face thereof,</hi> muſt teach Parents wiſdom to manage their duty aright towards their Children. Lower abilities ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with wiſdom prove more effectual than greater without it. What encouragement parents have to be importunate for this gift the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſhews us, Jam. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are to pray for a bleſſing upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duty towards their Children, with the concurrence of the Spirit to make all means uſed effectual. Prayer and Inſtruction; yea Prayer and Correction ought to go together. The moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, diligent and wiſe diſcharge of duty will leave Children graceleſs, unleſs God add his bleſſing. Now though a Covenant-ſtate be hereditary, yet Grace is not ſo, that's from God, given to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in a cpmpliance with his eternal Purpoſe and Decrees. But theſe being ſecret, hid in the breaſt of God, are not to be parents rule in the performance of their duty, they are to perform it equally and alike unto all. Let me add, the more Faith there is in Prayer, the more prevalent it will be; and how far Faith may be acted with reference to Children, may
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106622:122"/>be gathered from what hath been already ſaid. Among other things they may believe, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the firſt Grace do appertain to them indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, as members of that Collective Body to which thoſe Promiſes are made. And hence, though they cannot poſitively believe that theſe Promiſes ſhall be made good to every one of their Children, yet they may and ought to believe the truth and faithfulneſs of God, and anſwerably act a dependance upon him, with a comfortable hopethat the Good promiſed ſhall be givent to each one of their Children. I ſhall only add two or three Motives to preſs Parents to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of their duty, and ſo paſs from this third Queſtion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the manifold obligations lying upon you to be faithful, conſciencious, and diligent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and to paſs by all others, an account of which I have already given, let me only remind you of, and a little preſs upon you that reference and ſubſerviency that your diſcharge of your duty hath to your Childrens imbracement of the Covenant, and conſequently to God's bringing upon you in vouchſafing unto them the Good promiſed. That paſſage of God's concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abraham</hi> cannot well be too often inculcated upon believing Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. There are two things peculiarly remarkable in this Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To mention that in the firſt place which is ſet down in the latter part of the Verſe, the ſubſerviency of Parents faithful performance of their duty to God's bringing upon them the Good promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> with reference to their Children, <hi>That the Lord may bring upon him what be hath ſpoken of him;</hi> as if God could not (keeping exactly to the terms of the Covenant) vouchſafe the Good promiſed to Children, unleſs that
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106622:122"/>Parents be faithful in the performance of their duty towards them. It ſeems at leaſt very probable to infer an abſolute neceſſity of Parents performance of their duty in order to God's giving them the Good promiſed in purſuance of the Promiſe made to them on the behalf of their Children; however this muſt be ſaid, that Childrens forfeiture of their Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and all the Good annexed thereunto, is greatly hazarded by Parents failing therein. It's true, God may extend Mercy to them, and anſwerably ſupply the neglect of Parents, by the vouchſafement of tother means, as he doth to others born of unbelieving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, unto whom he is under no obligation by vertue of any peculiar Promiſe made to them: But it may ſeem that Parents neglect of their duty diſchargeth God from that obligation the is under by his Promiſe made to them on the behalf of their Children, and that muſt needs extremely hazard their ever injoying the Good of the Covenant. Now ſurely if any thing will cauſe ſorrow, or allay the joy of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at that day, againſt which joy is ſowen for the Righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart; this will do it, to miſs their Children in that day of Triumph, and that through their own deſault in point of duty towards them. Let me ſay, Is all the Good of the Covenant of ſo ſmall a value, as that a ſond affectio ſhall ſuperſede the diſcharge of your duty towards your Children? Or is everlaſting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the preſence of God, and the glory of his Power ſo ſmall a matter, as that rather than you will put your ſelves to a little pains, or impoſe any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty upon your Children. you will hazard that? Will their roaring in Hell be a leſs evil than their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſmart of the Rod? Alas! what do Parents
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106622:123"/>think of Heaven or Hell, that they will hazard their Childrens loſs of the one, and undergoing the other upon ſuch trivial accounts?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, what excellent incouragements you have to a vigorous, faithful, and conſciencious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of your duty towards them, which is the other thing remarkable in the forementioned Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> the iſſue and fruit of the diſcharge of your duty, <hi>They ſhall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> implying at leaſt the uſual concurrence of a bleſſing from God with the diſcharge of your duty, and concurrence of the Sapirit to make the means uſed effectual. God would not aſſert the efficacy of the means, but upon a ſuppoſition of his concurrence with them by his own Spirit and Bleſſing. It may poſſibly ſeem ſtrange to ſome, ſhould I ſay, whether ever any of the Seed of the Righteous apoſtatize from the ways of God, and thereby forfeit their Covenant-ſtate, but upon a failure in Parents in the due diſcharge of their duty, is a queſtion of more difficult determination, than is uſually apprehended, or appears at the firſt propoſal of it. But beſides the incouragement you have from this Scripture, how much more means have you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the converſion of your Children, than others, who either are unbelievers themſelves, or deny their Childrens Covenant-intereſt, have? how many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have you to preſs upon them? what incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to preopoſe to them? and conſequently what ground have you to hope for ſucceſs, that you ſhall not labour in vain? Theſe things I had ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have inlarged upon, but for ſome reaſons I ſhall contract. You may be ſufficiently furniſhed with incouragements from what hath been already ſaid. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:106622:123"/>3. Conſider, how great a good your Childrens converſion will be to your ſelves as well as unto them. Doth not the comfort of your lives depend much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the welfare of your Children? will it not highly advance your comfort, to be able to live in the World as in a ſtrange Land, as Heirs your ſelves, and as ſeeing your Children Joynt-heirs with you of an everlaſting ingheritance in Heaven? would it not be your joy to ſee the Kingdom of Chriſt upheld, his Church continued and propagated by thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of your own loyns? Beſides converting Grace will make them uſeful and ſerviceable unto you both in temporals and ſpirituals, See <hi>Philemon</hi> 11. Will it not doubly ſtrengthen your weak hands and feeble knees, when old age comes, to have them ſtrengthned and ſupported by the gracious words of your own Children? And ſurely, ſeeing Mothers have uſually moſt need of comfort from their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they ſhould be peculiarly careful to perform their duty towards them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. They may and ought to improve it as a help to their underſtandings, that they may better, and more clearly apprehend, and conceive of the means and way through and by which they have the pardon of ſin, peace with God, and muſt come to the actual injoyment of Salvation, (which as the Seed of ſuch Parents they were born Heirs unto) which are the Blood of Chriſt, as applyed to them for the purging away the guilt of ſin, and the Spirit of Chriſt, as gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the renovation of their natures. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Seals of the Covenant preſent to the eye what the Word preſents to the ear, and they are for the mutual illuſtration the one of the other. Now as this way, and theſe means are conſiderable under different notions, ſo they are ſhadowed and repreſented by different ſymbols or ſigns. The Blood of Chriſt, as purging away the guilt of ſin, was repreſented in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſion as to be ſhed; but it is repreſented in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as already ſhed, and applyed to the party bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. The body of ſin was repreſented in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106622:124"/>under the notion of a ſuperfluity to be amputed and cut off: 'Tis repreſented in Baptiſm under the notion of a defilement or pollution, which is removed by waſhing. But the uſe of the one and the other in general was and is the ſame, namely to repreſent to the mind that way, and thoſe means, by and through which the ſoul hath remiſſion of ſin, peace which God, and is brought to future Salvation. Now Children, when they are inſtructed about this way and theſe means, they may and ought to reflect upon their Baptiſm, and ſee how both are repreſented and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated thereby, and by means thereof, they may come to more clear notions and conceptions of and about them, Inſtructions by ſigns are adapted to the capacities of Children. Indeed the Sacraments are ordained in a compliance with the weakneſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in general. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which follows upon this, by the conſideration of their Baptiſm they will be kept under a due ſenſe of the indiſpenſible neceſſity of the Application of the Blood of Chriſt to them for their diſcharge from the guilt of ſin; and of the Spirit for their Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Renovation, in order to the continuing of their peace with God, and actual injoyment of future Salvation. And a threefold advantage will ariſe herefrom.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They will be put upon ſerious enquiries, how it is with themſelves, whether they have the Blood of Chriſt ſo applyed or no? and whether they are ſo waſht by Regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, or no?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How they may attain to the one and the other, and be quickned up to a diligent uſe of thoſe means,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106622:125"/>and prformance of thoſe duties they are directed to, ſubſervient thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They will be kept from any attempts to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a righteouſneſs of their own, on the one hand, and on the other from preſumptuous confiding in Chriſt without a real work of Regeneration and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. Baptiſm preacheth to all the way of pardon, peace with God, and future Salvation, to be by waſhing; by waſhing away the guilt of ſin by the Blood of Chriſt, and the filth of ſin by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And this indeed is the uſe and improvement that all Chriſtians ſhould make of their Baptiſm. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may and ought to improve their Baptiſm to ingage, provoke, and ſtir up themſelves to a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in with the Covenant, and uſe of all means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to their injoyment of the Grace and Bleſſings of it. As this is a ſpecial end of God in appointing the Applicatio of the Token of the Covenant to the Seed of Believers; ſo they are eſpecially to be taught to make that improvement of it, and anſwerably they may and ought to do it. What obligations ly upon them to cloſe in with the Covenant, and give up themſelves to God in Chriſt, according to the tenour of it, ariſing from the Appliſcation of the Token to them, have been already declared: And Parents ought diligently to inform and inſtruct them in and about them; which would they do, and back thoſe inſtructions with a due uſe of all the forementioned means to render them effectual, it may be rationally expected, they would have no little weight upon their hearts. And 'tis no ſmall part of the Mercy of the Seed of Believers, as brought under the bond of the Covenant by the Application of the Token thereof unto them, that they have ſuch obligations upon
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106622:125"/>them, whereby to provoke and ſtir up themſelves to an early ſeeking after God, and enquiring after his ways.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They may and ought to improve their Baptiſm for the help of their Faith and Hope, and for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to take hold of the Covenant: as alſo to ſeek unto God for Grace to inable them ſo to do. What an help it may be to their Faith and Hope, and what an incouragement to take hold of the Covenant they have thereby, may be concluded from what hath been already ſaid; and I muſt ſtill leave it to their Parents to inſtruct them therein, and ſhall haſten; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put a cloſe to the whole, I ſhall briefly touch upon one Queſtion, which that I ſhould ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what unto ſeems neceſſary. And that is, how long the Covenant-ſtate of the Seed of Believers, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their right to the Sign and Token of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is continued to them as the Seed of ſuch Parents? When do the conditions of the Covenant become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon themſelves, ſo as that upon their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure in the performance of that their Covenant-ſtate is for feited?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It muſt be granted, This is a Queſtion of no eaſie reſolution, neither is it meet upon ſeveral accounts that it ſhould be perfectly determined. The exact reſolution of it muſt be left to that day, when all ſecrets ſhall be made manifeſt; and therefore I ſhall not adventure far into it. I ſall only offer ſome more general things to conſideration, which may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently obviate and prevent ſuch doubts and fears that either Parents or Children are ſubject to, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their having forfeited their Covenant-ſtate, as might obſtruct their reſpective due improvement of it for the ſeveral uſes and ends aforementioned.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:106622:126"/>1. Let the unſearchable riches of the Goodneſs, Grace and Love of God in Chriſt be conſidered. The Scripture every where ſpeaks of the Goodneſs, Grace and Love of God in Chriſt as inveſtigable, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible by any humane underſtanding. Hence are ſuch paſſages, <hi>Oh how great is thy Goodneſs?</hi> Pſal. 31. <hi>How precious is thy Grace?</hi> Pſal. 36. So, <hi>God ſo loved the World.</hi> The Love of Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>paſt knowledge.</hi> And from the conſideration of the unſearchable riches of this Goodneſs, Grace and Love of God in Chriſt, it may be concluded, at leaſt comfortably hoped, that he hath not been very ſtrait or rigid (if I may ſo ſpeak) with the Seed of his People, and conſequently hath not himſted their ſtanding under the Covenant upon their Parents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the very firſt inſtant of their capability of any actual knowledge of ſupernatural things, or uſe of reaſon. We may rationally ſuppoſe, he bath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them ſome time to attain to ſome diſtinct knowledge, and to uſe their reaſon in cloſing in with, or rejecting the terms of the Covenant. And hence it muſt needs be exceeding uſeful for Parents to acquaint their Children betimes with the Nature of God, or if you will which is all one, (though that expreſſion hath been moſt unreaſonably quarrelled at by ſome) it muſt needs be highly uſeful to Children to be well acquainted with, and inſtructed in and about the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, into whoſe hand the adminiſtration of the Covenant is put. And here we have an inſtance of the uſefulneſs of acquaintance with the Perſon of Chriſt, with reference to things more darkly revealed in the Scriptures. It is not expreſsly revealed juſt when the performance of the condition of the Covenant becomes indiſpenſibly neceſſary to Children for the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106622:126"/>preſervation of their Covenant-ſtate: but now the knowledge of Chriſt, or of God in him, as how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable rich in Goodneſs, Grace and Love he is, may much relieve both Parents and Children under thoſe doubts and fears they are ſubject to about the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their Covenant-ſtate: They may conclude certainly God hath not been ſo rigid upon them, as to limit their ſtanding in it to ſo ſhort a time, as that the forfeiture of it ſhall be little leſs than neceſſary, or hardly in an ordinary way unavoidable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be further conſidered, that it may be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that God hath ſo extended the Covenant to the Seed of his People, as that their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation or refuſal of it ſhould appear to Angels and Men juſtly and rationally rewardable or puniſhable. This may be inferred from the Juſtice and Wiſdom of God, taken in conjunction with his ultimate end (<hi>viz.</hi> the Glorification of all his Attributes) in his dealings, eſpecially in a Covenant-way with Man. Now this ſeems neceſſarily to require that ſo much time ſhould be allowed them, as ſo far to underſtand, and make a judgment of the Covenant, as containing ſuch Promiſes upon ſuch terms, as that their acceptation or rejection ſhould be free and voluntary, and not either a mere inforcement of their Parents on the one hand, or on the other not the mere product of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh weakneſs and vanity. What may be objected againſt this from God's puniſhing Original ſin in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants will receive a ready anſwer from the difference between their caſes, and the caſes of the Infant-ſeed of Believers we now ſpeak of. But</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would ofter at leaſt as matter of enquiry, whether the Covenant is or can be broken by the Seed of Believers any others ways, than it would be broken
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106622:127"/>by Believers themſelves, ſuppoſing it poſſible for them to break it, which we grant, all things conſidered, it is not. Now it is not the bare ſuſpenſion of the due acting and exerciſe of Grace, no nor every commiſſion of ſin, no not of particular ſins of a very heinous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that breaks the Covenant between God and them. One of theſe three things I conceive are neceſſary thereunto. Either</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Man muſt make a free and voluntary choice of ſome falſe God, and anſwerably freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ingage in the worſhip and ſervice of ſuch a God. Or elſe</p>
               <p n="2">2. Muſt make a free and voluntary choice of ſome temporal good as his portion, and anſwerably ſet that up in his heart and affections above God, and purſue it as his ſupreme and chief good. Or elſe</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Man muſt with a free and full conſent of will ingage in ſome way of moral impieties, as deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not explicitly, yet implicitly the utmoſt of what happineſs he expects in this life in the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſatisfaction of the luſts of his own heart.<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Doctor Preſton</hi> on the Covenant.</note> I confeſs theſe things require a larger explication, but I can but touch upon them in general at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: But until one or another of theſe things be done, the Covenant is not broken, nor the Covenant-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between God and them diſſolved. Now I ſhall not be poſitive, only propoſe it as a matter of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whether the Covenant can be broken any other way by the Seed of Believers? This we may obſerve, that we have no inſtance in Scripture of God's reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the Seed of his People out of Covenant, but upon ſome overt act on their parts, evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their rejection of the Covenant one or the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:106622:127"/>other of thoſe ways mentioned, and that when grown up to a capacity of making a free and voluntary choice. Thoſe two inſtances of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and may be uſeful for the guiding our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this matter. The one, <hi>viz. Iſhmael</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently declares his rejection of the Covenant by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting his brother <hi>Iſaac.</hi> The other, <hi>viz. Eſau</hi> by ſeeling his birth-right. Now we know both theſe were grown up to a capacity of making a free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary choice. 'Tis true God may withdraw himſelf from ſome, and leave them to ſuch a rejection of the Covenant ſooner than he doth others; which may be a caution to all the Seed of Believers to take heed of deferring perſonaly to take hold of the Covenant. But whether their Covenant-ſtate be forfeited before ſuch an actual rejection of the Covenant, may be queſtioned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let it be conſidered, that until Childrens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Covenant one or another of the ways mentioned become apparent by ſome overt act on their parts, both their Parents and themſelves may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably hope (ſuppoſe they cannot poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude) the Covenant is not broken by them. While their omiſſions or commiſſions are only ſuch as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Saints, there is ground to hope the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may ſtand firm. And there is a double ground for ſuch a hope.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A poſſibility or probability that the Covenant may yet be continued to them upon their Parents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. This appears from the aforegoing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a poſſibility or probability that a ſeed of Grace may be wrought or implanted in the ſoul, though it have not exerted it ſelf in any ſenſible acts,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:106622:128"/>but hath been ſuppreſſed and kept under by the vain workings of a childiſh and youthful mind, and bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings forth of corruption. A ſeed of Grace may be, and often is ſowen in the hearts of the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the very dawning of their Youth or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which yet diſcovers not it ſelf for a long time after, at leaſt in any ſenſible acts of Grace. And hence it is that ſo many of the Seed of the Righteous can give no account of the time or means of their converſion. And it may be from this Seed of Grace, that the Soul, though it have not actually recognized the Covenant, nor explicitly cloſed in with God in Chriſt, yet is preſerved from rejecting the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant any of the ways mentioned. Now whilſt ſuch as are deſcended from believing Parents have any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ground to hope that the Covenant between God and them is inviolate, they may take great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the conſideration of it to cloſe in with Chriſt, and ſeek for renewing Grace. Yet</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let me add one thing more, and that is this, While the Seed of Believers are kept from an abſolute rejection of the Covenant, though they may have a great while neglected to recognize it, and make an actual ſaving cloſe with Chriſt, and anſwerably may not yet have a ſaving work of Grace wrought in them, there is ground of hope, they may yet abide for God, and God may abide for them, as the Prophet ſpeaks. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3. And ſuppoſe the Covenant ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited according to the exact terms of it, and God might have juſtly taken the forfeiture, yet the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Covenant as entred with them in their Infancy, as the Seed of ſuch Parents, may be improved by them as a very great incouragement at laſt to take hold of the Covenant. God in ſuch caſes is exceeding
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106622:128"/>ready to renew his Covenant with the Seed of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This ſeems to be one of the great incouragements that the <hi>Jews</hi> will have to return unto God, when he takes away the vail from off their hearts; <hi>behold,</hi> ſay they, <hi>We come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God,</hi> Jer. 3.22. The words are, as an invitation from God to them to return, ſo a Propheſie of their anſwering that invitation in the latter age of the World. Now they will not be able to lay claim to an actual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation between God and them, for that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was long ſince broken through their unbelief; but they have abode for God, and God hath abode for them, and as having ſo abode the one for the other, they call him their God, and incourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the conſideration of the deſignation (as I may ſo ſpeak) that God hath made of them for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of himſelf to be a God and Husband unto them, giving them a kind of incomplete and remote intereſt in him, to return to God. Thoſe that God hath kept for himſelf, and for whom he abides, he will readily receive when they return to him: And this may greatly incourage Patents with reference to their Chirldren as grown up; though they do not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence any ſaving work of Grace, ye they are kept from one or another of the ways whereby the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is broken; it may be they abide for God, and he abides for them, he may keep them out of a deſgin yet at laſt to marry them to himſelf. And as it may incourage Parents in their hopes concerning their Children, ſo it may greatly incourage Children to cloſe in with Chriſt, and thereby renew their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. So that we may ſee, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be properly determined how long the Covenant-intereſt of Children is continued upon their Parents
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106622:129"/>account, yet that ſhould be no prejudice to their taking the full incouragement to believe, and cloſe in with Chriſt, and ſeek for that Grace promiſed to inable them thereunto, that their Covenant-ſtate hath an aptitude to yeeld to them. They may take all the incouragements afore declared that they have, though there be an uncertainty about the preciſe time when the condition of the Covenant devolves upon themſelves. To come then to a cloſe; I ſhall only ſpeak a few words to the Children of Believers, and let me ſay to you, You now ſee what a glorious ſtate you are in asunder the Covenant, and intereſted in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes thereof. Will you now refuſe ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? yea, will you not only refuſe ſo great Grace when offered, but reject it when granted to you, by neglecting to take hold of the Covenant already entred with you, or ſeeking unto God for his Spirit, through whoſe aſſiſtance your duty will be made eaſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to you? and this not only when you are under the greateſt obligations to accept of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naut, but when you have ſo many incouragements above what the reſt of Mankind have to hope for a ready acceptation with God, and concurrence of his Spirit and Bleſſing to aſſiſt you in the performance of your duty, and ſucceed all your endeavours for Grace? Oh how will you of all Perſons appear at the great day of the Lord that is ready to come upon you? Where do you think to ſtand at that day? Were you to get into ſuch an eſtate, your incouragements would be leſs; but it is only your continuance in that ſtate that you are to ſecure. God hath (as I may ſo ſpeak) brought you again into Paradiſe, and will you again caſt your ſelves out? Surely of all Perſons in the World you will be leaſt able to relieve your
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:106622:129"/>ſelves under your miſery, by pleading the neceſſity of your ruine, that it was <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Parent of Mankind, that brought it upon you. You are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the guilt you were under as in his loyns, you are actuall received into the Covenant of Grace. The Law cannot condemn you, 'tis only your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the new Covenant, and that when actually entred with you that can be your condemnation. And if you ſay we cannot change our own natures; remember you are of that Houſe or Family to which the Promiſes of ſaving Grace do appertain, yea you are in a peculiar and eſpecial manner in ſome reſpects above the reſt of that Houſe or Family the Object of theſe Promiſes, and therefore know your own Mercies and Priviledges, and do not wilfully caſt your ſelves out of ſo glorious an eſtate, nor deprive your ſelves of ſuch a glorious Inheritance, or Inheritance in glory you were born Heirs unto.</p>

            <p>SO great and glorious are thoſe priviledges, benefits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that have been aſſigned to the ſeed of Believers, as received into the Covenant of Grace, and having the Covenant with the promiſes appertaining to them ratified ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed to them by the application of the token there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it cannot be rationally expected that what hath been ſaid ſhould meet with a ready imbracement by conſciencious Chriſtians, while either the grounds of that their Covenant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and right to the token, or the neceſſary redundancy of theſe peiviledges benefits and advantages therefrom remain obſcure and inevident to them: As for the neceſſary redundancy of theſe priviledges benefits and advantages from their Covenant-ſtate, taken in conjunction with the promiſes appertaining to them, as the one and the other are ratified ſealed and confirmed by the application of the token, I conceive that is ſufficiently evident from the foregoing diſcourſe. I ſhall add no more to that; But it ſeems ſomewhat neceſſary that I ſhould a little reflect upon both the grounds laid to their Covenant-Intereſt, and the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the application of the token to them on the account thereof (for the eſtabliſhment of which I have amongſt others caſt in my mite in a Treatiſe ſometime ſince publiſhed) which in the general are theſe two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the tenour of the Covenant it ſelf both in reſpect of the promiſſory and preceptive part of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the practice of the Church and People of God throughout all ages in appropriating the Covenant with the promiſes of it, and applying the token to their Inſant-ſeed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to us partly by Scripture, and partly by Eccleſiaſtical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; becauſe two late Authots have endeavoured to raiſe ſome duſt for the obſcruing both of them, and hiding their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from perſons of leſs peircing underſtandings and weaker Judgment: As for the one of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> his main deſign being only to hide the latter of theſe grounds, and that as the knowledg of it is conveyed to us by Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory which we ſtand not much upon, it being enough, if ſo be it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear from Scripture that the tenour of the Covenant be ſuch as neceſſarily infers the Infant-ſeed of Believers intereſt
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106622:130"/>in it, and right to the token of it, and that anſwerably the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church and People of God, during the times Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-records extend unto, was to appropriate the Covenant, and apply the token of it to their infant Seed. Hence I ſhall add little beyond what I have elſewhere ſaid for the ſcattering of that duſt raiſed by him, partly becauſe the main deſign he hath ſeen meet to lay out himſelf in purſuance of is but of an inferiour impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and more eſpecially becauſe of the little ground there is to fear that what he has done in purſuance of his deſign ſhould be muchregarded in ſuch an age of light as this is, the practice of the Church being ſo generally among all learned Men known to be otherwiſe than he endeavours to repreſent it; beſides, his own Book ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

As for the Gentleman himſelf, I am an equal ſtranger to him as to Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and therefore can have no prejudice againſt either of their Perſons, neither would I in the leaſt diſcourage or oppoſe any in any attempts to further the deciſion of this great Controverſie; why ſhould I grudge any the Eberty that my ſelf have taken? only I could wiſh that thoſe, that conceive themſelves under a call to appear either in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of what they conceive to be according to truth, or againſt what they conceive to be oppoſite thereunto, would remember that exhortation of the Apoſtle to <hi>timothy,</hi> where he exhorts him to ſhew himſelf a Workman that need not be aſhamed. 'Tis true, unavoidable failures will attend humane weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, which may juſtly cauſe ſomewhat of ſhame; but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding them, the deſign and intendment of that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be anſwered. Whether our Author have ſhewed himſelf ſuch a Workman will preſently appear; whether himſelf be ſo free from Gall and Vinegar (which he ſo vehemently impeaches his Oppoſites writings of) as becomes a reprover, I ſhall leave to the judgment of others; 'tis what he hath written, not the manner of his writing, that I ſhall concern my ſelf about. To begin with this Treatiſe of the Covenant; three things ly ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

            <p>Firſt, He ſuppoſes, the only ground that can be laid to the Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm of Infants, is their relation to <hi>Abraham</hi> as his Seed. Hence having, as he ſuppoſes, proved that they can ſtand in no ſuch relation to him, he conceives he has utterly overthrown their Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm, thus <hi>Page</hi> 3. A groſs miſtake, we found their Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip and Baptiſm upon the tenour of the Covenant as made with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed in their Generation, that is, with them and their natural Children, but whether they are to have the denomination of, and are to be reckoned among <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, is another Queſtion.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are no other than what our Author himſelf fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Holy Ghoſt (to uſe his Phraſe) in affirming ſome Infants to be ſaved without a perſonal Faith; for it may be thus argued; If none are ſaved but ſuch as believe, then no Infants can be ſaved; but the antecedent is true, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved:</hi> and if it be ſaid that's meant of the Adult; the ſame ſuppoſed abſurdity will follow; for, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Author, then Chriſt muſt be ſuppoſed to ſay, he that believes and he that believes not ſhall be ſaved. Let him avoid the abſurdity in the one, and we ſhall alike avoid the abſurdity in the other.</p>
            <p>Another miſtake that he proceeds upon is, That at leaſt ſome Paedo-Baptiſts may aſcribe their Childrens intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and conſequently may plead that though their Children have no right to the Covenant by vertue of their Parents Faith, yet they may have a right to it by vertue of <hi>Abraham's,</hi> thus <hi>Page</hi> 12, and he ſpends about ten Pages to confute this Plea that he ſuppoſes ſome Paedo-Baptiſts may make: which is a mere miſtake about his Oppoſers Principles, or rather a mere impertinency; for where hath he found in all the writings of Paedo-Baptiſts ſuch a Plea managed? and hence
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106622:131"/>whereas he ſuppoſes himſelf to have utterly overthrown the chief grounds laid by Paedo-Baptiſts to the Covenant-intereſt and Baptiſm of the Infant-ſeed of Believers, and thereupon tells us <hi>Page</hi> 22. he might end the matter there; the truth is, he hath ſaid nothing at all to the purpoſe, but proceeded merely upon miſtakes; neither the one nor the other of the grounds that he ſuppoſes Paedo-Baptiſts bottom their claim to the Covenant-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Baptiſm of their Infant-ſeed upon, is the true ground they bottom that their claim upon; whence his diſcourſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath been utterly impertinent, of no uſe at all as to the end he deſigns by it.</p>
            <p>Another thing rendring his whole diſcourſe uſeleſs to me, is his aſſuming and taking for granted without the leaſt ſhew or proof what he knew, at leaſt might have known, is abſolutely denied by at leaſt ſome if not a conſiderable part of Paedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. I ſhall inſtance in three things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Covenant entred with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in their Generation did extend to and take in all his Seed at leaſt deſcended by <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> during their firſt-Teſtament-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and that merely as his Seed; upon this ſuppoſition he proceeds in a conſiderable part of his Book; but now he knew, at leaſt might have known, that this is abſolutely denied, and on the other hand it is affirmed, that <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s grandchild, was not in Covenant merely as he was of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Poſterity, but as he was the child of believing <hi>Iſaac</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with him in that Phraſe, <hi>thy Seed in their Generations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He aſſumes and takes for granted, that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is made with the Elect as ſuch, and conſequently that all the Elect and only they are in the Covenant of Grace; hence he tells us <hi>Page</hi> 23. that the Covenant or Promiſe of eternal Life (which he calls (and I blame him not for it) the Covenant of Grace) is only proper to the Elect. This he might have known would be denied; and it is on the contrary affirmed that no Covenant is actually made with any of the Elect as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He affirms, and takes it for granted, that that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, called by the Apoſtle <hi>the old Covenant,</hi> which was then vaniſhing, is a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he might have known is denied, and that it is affirmed, that that Covenant ſpoken of by the Apoſtle, is that Covenant made with the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and his affirming ſo many things, and proceeding in a conſiderable part of his Book upon a ſuppoſition of the truth of them, when they are all miſtakes and unſound
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106622:132"/>ſuppoſitions, his whole Diſcourſe muſt needs be, if not wholly, yet in a great meaſure uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which yet further renders his Treatiſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſs to me, is the great confuſion attended with ſeveral abſurdities and contradictions that it labours under: thus for his whole Diſcourſe upon that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. beginning <hi>Page</hi> 22. and reaching to <hi>Page</hi> 39. this confuſion, with the abſurdities and contradictions attending it, will appear, if we take notice of ſome of his aſſertions, and compare them one with another, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with what they do, either as taken ſingly or joyntly, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily infer and imply, thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He poſitively affirms, that the Covenant of Grace, and its Adminiſtration, are two diſtinct Covenants, thus, <hi>Page</hi> 23. and tells us <hi>Page</hi> 93. that the Covenant of Circumciſion, which muſt neceſſarily intend that Covenant which before he affirmed to be the Adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace, may be called a Covenant of Works, and then a Covenant of Works may be the Adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace; which, whether rational and congruous, I ſhall leave all Men to judge.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He expreſsly affirms, that the Adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace under the New Teſtament is called the New Covenant; thus again, <hi>Page</hi> 23. where it is evident, he hath reference to <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8. and then all thoſe Promiſes there mentioned by the Apoſtle of God's putting his Law in the mind are not of the ſubſtance, only appertain to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He affirms, at leaſt neceſſarily implyes, that that grand Promiſe of the Covenant, wherein God promiſes to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, as made to one, yea to one and the ſame Perſon, as conſidered under one notion, appertains on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Adminiſtration, but as made to another or to the ſame Perſon conſidered under another notion, is of the eſſence and ſubſtance of the Covenant of Grace, thus <hi>Page</hi> 26. he tells us (ſpeaking of this very Promiſe) that in it God promiſed only to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s fleſhly Seed to be a God to them in giving them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but to his ſpiritual Seed to be a God to them in giving unto them eternal Life; and he takes <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be the ſubject of the Promiſe as taken both ways, and the Promiſes as made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s fleſhly Seed he calls the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which elſewhere he ſays was but the Adminiſtration of the Covenant, and may be called a Covenant of Works. And what confuſion and what abſurdities this implyes, let every one judge. But to get out of theſe dark labyrinths,</p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:106622:132"/>
            <p>Fourthly, He affirms, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf by vertue of his fleſhly deſcent, as he ſpeaks, had no intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, ſo he tells us <hi>Page</hi> 27. and yet,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He poſitively affirms, that none had or have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Covenant of Grace, but through a perſonal Faith in Chriſt, thus <hi>Page</hi> 28. which as it directly contradicts what he had ſaid of the Covenant of Grace, its being made only with the Elect, and with all them; for ſure he will grant ſome are Elect that are not actual Believers: ſo it utterly deprives <hi>Iſaac</hi> as well as all the reſt of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and indeed all Infants whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of any benefit by the Covenant of Grace, by which yet he affirms them to be ſaved, ſuppoſing their Election and Death in their Infancy. Let us ſee then what a Good God promiſed to <hi>Iſaac</hi> as one of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, why only this, that he would be a God to him in giving him the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which yet he never did, nor ever intended to give him: Of what uſe ſuch a confuſed abſurd and contradictory diſcourſe can be to any, I cannot imagine. I might yet further ſhew what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his diſcourſe uſeleſs to me, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his overlooking ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of none of the leaſt forcible Scriptures and Scripture-argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced by his Oppoſers in confirmation of their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Practice; but I ſhall go no further, but leave his Book to every one to make what uſe they ſee meet of it. And proceed to his Animadverſions upon my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Danvers.</hi> Indeed would but Readers take Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s Book and my Anſwer, with my former Treatiſe ſo often referred to, and his Animadverſions, and peruſe them with equal and unbyaſſed minds, it would be all that I deſire; yet that all Men may ſee how needleſs a thing it is to make any Returns to ſuch Replyes, as theſe Animadverſions carry a ſhew of, and may know how to regulate their expectations for the future,</p>
            <p>I ſhall with much brevity review them. My Anſwer conſiſts of three parts.</p>
            <p>In the firſt I lay down ſeveral conſiderations with reference to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s authorities. In the two firſt, which Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> more eſpecially takes notice of, I charge him with unfaithfulneſs and impertinency, in reſpect of both which Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> pretends his vindication. For the former, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his unfaithfulneſs, I only gave two Inſtances, and both in his Quotations out of the <hi>Magdi-Burgenſian Hiſtory,</hi> for the truth of which charges, I ſhall refer the Reader to that Famous Hiſtory; with this only remark beyond my Anſwer it ſelf, that there is a vaſt difference between, ſaying, they find they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106622:133"/>baptiſed only the Adult, and they only find they baptized the Adult: indeed they neither ſay the one or the other, but the direct contrary; yet allow our Oppoſers the utmoſt they can with the leaſt ſhew of reaſon deſire, it is only the latter that can be ſaid of them; And ſurely there is a greater difference between ſaying they find they baptized only the Adult, and they only find the Adult were baptized, than is between two ſix pences and a ſhilling: hence no Man can excuſe him of unfaithfulneſs; but he will find at laſt he hath given juſt cauſe to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to accuſe himſelf. For the other <hi>(viz.)</hi> his impertinencies, and thus Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> pretends his vindication two ways.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Recrimination.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By acquitting his Book of that charge.</p>
            <p>For this latter I ſhall only refer the Reader to my Book, with the inſtances there given.</p>
            <p>For the former, I have only this to ſay: Whether that inſtance given by Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> will prove his charge, I ſhall not be Judge, but this may be ſaid, for me to be guilty only of one impertinency (and but one is charged upon me,) is no juſt vindication of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> in the multitude I have charged upon him. And this I ſhall add, that had I known all Mens hearts, as well as Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> pretends to know mine, and had ſeen no ſuch objection, as that ſuppoſed impertinency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the obviating of, I had not been guilty of that one neither, but that ſuch an objection may poſſibly enter into the minds of men Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s Book abundantly confirms me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall be ſo far further impertinent, as to tell him, I am yet in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> and conſequently if I had any ſuch deſign as he intimates his ſuſpition I had, it has miſcarried, only I have this in lieu, that being freed from family-intanglements, I have a greater liberty to attend the ſervice of Chriſt in vindicating his truths from ſuch aſſailants. But to go on, the ſecond part of my Anſwer ſhews the inſufficiency of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> proofs for Believers Baptiſm in oppoſition to that of Infants, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon's</hi> Animadverſions. To this part I ſhall only remark three things, and leave them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Is his complyance with me, in what he yet ſeems, and that with ſevere reflections upon me, to oppoſe, thus in all thoſe inſtances I had given of things indeterminable by the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the preaching of the Goſpel, and adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to evidence the neceſſity of taking in other Scriptures for the full underſtanding of Chriſt's mind therein.</p>
            <pb n="251" facs="tcp:106622:133"/>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Huthinſon</hi> himſelf does, what I ſay we ought to do, neither dares he deny any of thoſe things I offer to conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſhew the invallidity of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Argument drawn from that Commiſſion; and yet with what vehemency does he ſeem to oppoſe it?</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the groſs miſtakes Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> proceeds upon; thus he miſtakes my very deſign in this part of my Book, ſuppoſes me to be proving Infant-Baptiſm, when that is none of my deſign or buſineſs; that he proceeds on this miſtake is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as from variety of Paſſages, ſo eminently from that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph <hi>Page</hi> 21. beginning about line 18. ſo alſo from <hi>Page</hi> 55. upper end, hence what he animadverts with the greateſt ſhew of plauſability as concerning the baptizing of the Children of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, <hi>Bells,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Page</hi> 17. is wholly impertinent: Alas! how eaſie to ſhew, that that will not prove any Doctrine or Practice, which was never deſigned for that end?</p>
            <p>Again, as he miſtakes my deſign and buſineſs, ſo he miſtakes about the ground I would have laid for Infant-Baptiſm, had it been my work there to prove that Practice; Hence he ſuppoſes that I take it for granted, that Infants were Chuch-members under the Law, <hi>Page</hi> 22. when I neither did, nor had any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to meddle with their Church-memberſhip either under the Law, or under the Goſpel: And he ſtill goes upon his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in his attempts to ſhew the repeal of that Priviledge, from <hi>Paul's</hi> preaching that the <hi>Gentiles ought not to circumciſe their Children,</hi> he ſuppoſes that Circumciſion gave a right to, as well as the actual poſſeſſion of Church-memberſhip, and that we hold the command for Circumciſion did vertually include a command for Baptiſm, both which are groſs miſtakes. That which gave a right to Church-memberſhip was the Covenant, and it is the command to keep the Covenant that obliges to Baptiſm: but Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> either cannot, or will not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between that command as more generally laid down, and reaching all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, whether natural or myſtical, and the command laid upon <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed to obſerve that ſpecial Rite of Circumciſion, as the Covenant, that is, the Token of the Covenant, then to be kept: and alas! what heed can be given to Men that proceed upon ſuch groſs miſtakes?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That which lies alike plain and obvious with both the foregoing particulars is his overlooking what he ought to have taken notice of. Thus he wholly overlooks all that I had written in my former Treatiſe deſignedly for the proof of Infant-Baptiſm, and whereunto I often refer in this my Anſwer, though
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:106622:134"/>he had ſeen it: So he takes no notice of what intimations I gave of offering ſomething further to publike view (which is now made publick) concerning the Doctrine of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as Infants are concerned therein; and from his overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of both a conſiderable part of his Animadverſions are either wholly impertinent, as to me, or in anſwering a matter before he hath heard it; take for an inſtance his whole Diſcourſe upon that Promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. beginning <hi>Page</hi> 26. and ending <hi>Page</hi> 30. yea he overlooks what is written in this very Book he animadverts upon. Hence <hi>Page</hi> 11. he calls for a reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſeeming contradictions, which had been needleſs, had he attended to what he might have found in <hi>Page</hi> 13, 14, 15 of my Anſwer; Hence again are thoſe Queſtions <hi>Page</hi> 30. about the Salvation of all in the houſes of Believers, which are anſwered at the 113th <hi>Page</hi> and ſo on of my Anſwer; and Men will make but ſorry work in their Replyes to our Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon any Book, when they overlook what their Antagoniſts have written, or declare their intentions to write.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, My Anſwer conſiſts in a vindication of thoſe grounds laid by Paedo-Baptiſts for their Judgment and Practice. As to what Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> animadverts upon this part, I need ſay little, he ſeems to have been himſelf utterly at a loſs what to ſay, yea he ſeems to be in a kind of maze, witneſs that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, (the only Argument he lays down ſyllogiſtically in his Animadverſion) <hi>Page</hi> 39. unleſs he be greatly abuſed by the Printer; witneſs alſo his crying out <hi>Ignoratio Elencht,</hi> where no Argument was laid down by me; yet once again witneſs his reaſonings <hi>Page</hi> 47. Hence he wholly paſſes over theſe ſeveral Arguments I had occaſionally laid down to prove the tenour of the Covenant to be ſuch as infallibly infers the intereſt of the Seed of Believers in it, excepting only, that afterwards he ſingles out here and there a paſſage without due regard to their Contexts, and animadverts upon them at his pleaſure, and himſelf becomes opponent, and pretends to determine three of thoſe four Queſtions I had ſaid the reſolution of which were neceſſary, and ſufficient for the diſcovery of the grounds laid in the Covenant, as at firſt eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for Infant-Baptiſm, which he only does by a naked repetition of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> unproved dictates, with the addition of ſome by diſcourſes which appertain not to the Queſtions propoſed, and yet hath the confidence to conclude <hi>Page</hi> 47. So then theſe things being found mere miſtakes on Mr. <hi>Whiſtons</hi> ſide, we may
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106622:134"/>conclude they have no footing in the Covenant for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And alſo what does he think of the Men, even of his own perſwaſion? can he think there is any of them ſo weak, or ſo far blinded, as not to ſee the frivolouſneſs of ſuch Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions? But not to tire the Reader, only I muſt beg Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s patience a little longer, I have a few words to him and have done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Sir,</hi> I aſſure you I have read, yea had read, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> ſaw the light, that Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Doctor <hi>Owen,</hi> and in ſpecial that part of it you refer me to, and can find nothing in that, or any other of his writings, as a cure to that ignorance you ſpeak of, I am at as great a loſs about thoſe Promiſes Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as I was before, and muſt tell you, you greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and conſequently greatly wrong that learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Author. How you and Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> look upon your ſelves I know not, but certainly I ſhould be juſtly cenſured as a very unworthy Man, ſhould I wreſt Authors words, who are yet alive, to countenance my own ſentiments in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to their known practice, before I had conſulted the Authors themſelves, and known how they would reconcile their words and practice. Will you but read the whole Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and allow him the liberty that all writers, whether ſacred or humane, uſe, you will find he is vaſtly more for me than for you; He is only ſhewing how God did preſerve <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Poſterity as grown up in a viſible ſtanding under the Covenant till our Lord Chriſt came, that the Promiſe made to him concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> coming of his loyns might be accompliſhed, he meddles not with the caſe of Infants, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them viſibly in Covenant as the Seed of Parents viſibly ſo; when will you leave thus to abuſe Authors whoſe names are precious in all the Churches of Chriſt? But</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have a few things to reccommend to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and theſe are of two ſorts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Such as concern my ſelf, thus <hi>Page</hi> 3. where you uſe the Poets words, ſo <hi>Page</hi> 5. <hi>line</hi> 10, 11. <hi>Page</hi> 26. <hi>line</hi> the laſt, <hi>Page</hi> 22. <hi>line</hi> 1, 2. with others of a like nature: can you prove what you have written? if not, what will you call theſe things?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such as concern matter of Fact: thus ſee what you write <hi>Page</hi> 3. where do I ſay Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Book is all forgery,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106622:135"/>or leave that to the Readers obſervation? See alſo <hi>Page</hi> 4. <hi>line</hi> 2. again ſee what you write <hi>Page</hi> 34. three laſt lines, and compare it with my Anſwer <hi>Page</hi> 39. and 40. will you or any Man elſe deny what I there take for granted? Again ſee what you write <hi>Page</hi> 7. <hi>line</hi> 24, 25. Is the ſilence of the Scripture, as abſolutely conſidered, my beloved Argument, yea or any Argument at all? I only enquire (and give my Reaſons for the affirmation,) whether, ſuppoſing the Covenant was extended to the Seed of Believers under the firſt Teſtament, (which I judged I had formerly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved that it was,) what may be truly ſaid of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Scripture, (not whether the ſilence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as abſolutely taken) concerning the Baptiſm of Infants do not make it vaſtly more probable that they ought, then that they ought not to be baptized: and that ſuppoſition being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I judge I ſhall have but few gain-ſayers. Yet again, ſee what you write <hi>Page</hi> 50. <hi>line</hi> 1, 2. and compare it with my Anſwer, <hi>Page</hi> 117, 118, 119. and ſee whether there is any ſuch reaſon given by me or no; you may alſo reflect upon your 18th <hi>Page,</hi> and conſider, whether what I ſuppoſe be a granting that the commiſſion was given only with reſpect to the Adult. <hi>Sir,</hi> I cannot think you can have ſuch a value for your Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions as you ſuppoſe me to have for my Book, as for others I can hardly think there is any one learned Man of your own Perſwaſion but will bluſh to ſee ſuch Animadverſions fly abroad from the pen of any of their party. <hi>Sir,</hi> I have only one thing more, and that is to intreat you not to complain of unmerciful dealing; will you ſeriouſly review your Book; you will find I have dealt gently with you; and that you may not ſay I have wronged you, if you deſire it, and can procure the teſtimony of any two learned Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts that they judge your Book deſerves, or can know that any two conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious learned Paedo-Baptiſts judge it deſerves a more full conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, your deſire (if providence interpoſe not) ſhall be gratified.</p>
