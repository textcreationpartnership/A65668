1. An Eſſay to revive the Primitive Doctrine of Infant-Baptiſm.

    _ CHAP. I. An Introduction to the whole enſuing Diſcourſe. The four grand Enquiries propoſed. The Reaſons of God's ordaining the Application of the token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People, reduced to three heads: The firſt (viz.) thoſe respecting God, entred upon, three Reaſons respecting God aſſigned. Firſt, his own Goodneſs, Grace, and Soveraign pleaſure. 2. The Reference that the Application of the token of the Covenant hath to his Glory, the Ways how it refers thereunto, opened. 3. The reference it hath to the ſupportation and enlargement of the Kingdome of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.

    _ CHAP. II The Reaſons of God's ordaining the Application of the Token of the Covenant to the Infant-ſeed of his People reſpecting the Parent from three Reaſons now aſſigned. 1. The advantages ariſing therefrom to their Faith. Howgreatly their Faith is advantaged thereby ſhewed. 2. It is for the advantage of their Joy and Comfort in their Children. 3. It is that God may thereby lay greater Obligations upon them to endeavour the Converſion of their Children and their Perſonal Embracement of the Covenant as growing up to years of Maturity. Thy variety of Obligations lying upon Paedo-Baptiſts ſo to do above what Anti-Paedo-Baptiſts can apprehend themſelves to ly under opened . How much greater ground of hope for ſucceſs in their endeavours Paedo-Baptiſts have, than Anti-Pedo-Baptiſts according to their Principle can have, ſhewed. The third Head of Reaſons, viz. Such as reſpect the Seed of Believers mentioned.

    _ CHAP. III. The ſecond Queſtion propoſed. A brief Introduction to the Anſwer of it. The firſt benefit that the Seed of Believers receive by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them declared, viz. They have thereby a ſolemn admiſſion into, and Memberſhip in the viſible Church, Kingdom, or Family of Chriſt. An Objection anſwered. The good redounding to them by that their admiſſion and Memberſhip ſhewed in two Inſtances. 1. They are comprehended in, and have an equal benefit with the reſt of the Members of the Church, by all theſe prayers put up for the Church in general. 2. They are under that ſpecial providential care that Chriſt exerciſeth over his Church. 3. Queſtions relating thereunto reſolved.

    _ CHAP. IV. The good redounding to the Infant-ſeed of Believers from their admiſſion into, and memberſhip in the viſible Church, Kingdom, or Family of Chriſt, further opened in a third inſtance, viz. They ſtand nigher than the reſt of Mankind to, and are the more eſpecial Objects of the Promiſes of ſaving Grace. Some of theſe Promiſes mentioned. The full Good contained in them unfolded. That the Seed of Believers, as members of the viſible Church, do ſtand nigher to them, than the reſt of Mankind, fully proved. An exaggeration of Parents evil in rejecting their Childrens Church-memberſhip.

    _ CHAP. V. The ſecond Good or Benefit accruing to the Seed of Believers by the Application of the Token of the Covenant propoſed, viz. They have thereby the Covenant, with the Promiſes thereof appertaining to them, ratified ſealed and confirmed. An Enquiry made, whether the Covenant and Promiſes are entred with, and made to the Seed of Believers, definitly or only indefinitly. The various judgments of Paedo-Baptiſts about it. That they are entred and made definitely, proved two wayes. Firſt, In the inſtance of Abraham's Seed immediatly proceeding from his own Loyns: where two Reaſons are offered. Secondly, It is further proved by three Reaſons reſpecting both Abraham's and all other Believers Seed. The forementioned good accruing to the Seed of Believers opened in the reſolution of two Queſtions. The former propoſed, viz. What the Token of the Covenant has reference unto. That it has a twofold reference ſhewed. Firſt, To the Covenant as abſtractly and abſolutely conſidered. The thing ratified, ſealed and confirmed by it,
as conſidered in that its reference, determined to be their Covenant. That the neceſſary reſult of which is proved by two Arguments to be their diſcharge from the guilt and condemning power of Originalſin, and that both Originans and Originatum.

    _ CHAP. VI. The ſecond reference of the Token of the Covenant declared, where two Queſtions are reſolved. Friſt, What Promiſes appertain to the Seed of Believers as ſuch. Theſe determined to be only two. Firſt, That God will be a God to them. Secondly, That they ſhall be ſaved. The ſecond Queſtion, (viz.) What is the Good contained in theſe Promiſes. The Good contained in the latter more briefly ſhewed. The Good contained in the former, more largely inſiſted upon. A twofold Good determined to be contained in it. Firſt, A Covenant-relation is conſtituted by it between God and the Seed of Believers. Secondly, God by it has put himſelf under an obligation to communicate himſelf to, and act for their Good and Benefit. Thoſe communications of himſelf to, and theſe actings for their Good and Benefit that God has obliged himſelf to, ſhewed to be limited three ways. Where it is ſhewed, that this Promiſe of God's being a God to his People, whether Infants or Adult, does not, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, either for the preſent
confer, or for the future abſolutely enſure, any particular Good contained in any of the Promiſes of the Goſpel upon, or to any intereſted in it; but is only an obligation upon God to make them all good according to their true tenour, and upon ſuppoſition of their condition being performed by man. This proved more generally by one Argument. That confirmed in the ſeveral branches of it.

    _ CHAP. VII. That the foremenioned Good, and that only, is contained in that grand Promiſe of the Covenant, further confirmed in ſome particular Inſtances. The firſt Inſtance propoſed. No ſpecial or ſaving influences or operations of the Spirit are included in this Promiſe, ſo as by it, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, to be conferred upon, or abſolutely enſured to any intereſted in it. The ſeveral uſes and ends of theſe influences and operations, declared. What is affirmed, proved. First, more generally. Secondly, more particularly. One Objection anſwered. A ſecond Inſtance propoſed: where it is proved, That no Love that is peculiar and proper to the Elect, is expreſt or enſured in or by this grand Promiſe of the Covenant, as taken abſolutely and by it ſelf, to all interested in it. This largly inſisted upon. What may be pleaded against it, anſwered.
A brief Recapitulation of that Good redounding to the Seed of Believers, as received into Covenant with their Parents, and having theſe two Promiſes appertaining to them. That Good ſummed up under four Heads. That the Seed of Believers have all Good, proved by four Arguments. The ſecond Queſtion for the unfolding this ſecond Good or Benefit ariſing to the Seed of Believers from the Application of the Token of the Covenant, propoſed: where it is ſhewed wherein the Benefit and Advantage of having the Covenant with the Promiſe of it ratified, ſealed and confirmed by an outward Sign or Token, does conſist. What hazard is run by the neglect of the Application of the Token of the Covenant, ſhewed.

    _ CHAP. VIII. Several Objections anſwered. The firſt raiſed from the impoſſibility that God ſhould do ſo much for the Seed of Believers, and yet not regenerate them. That anſwered, and the contrary thereunto ſhewed to be highly rational. The ſecond is, that what they have is only according to a viſible appearance, but not in reality and truth. That anſwered, where it is ſhewed what they appear or ſeem to have, they muſt needs have in reality and truth. The third raiſed from the inconſiſtency of granting the Infant ſeed of Believers ſo much with the Doctrine of Saints Perſeverance. That fully anſwered. The fourth raiſed from the inconſiſtency of granting ſo much to all the Seed of Believers with the Doctrine of Election. That fully anſwered. The fifth is, that the Infants of Believers have nothing beyond what the Seed of others have. That briefly anſwered.

    _ CHAP. IX. The third Benefit accrewing to the Seed of Believers by the Application of the Token of the Covenant to them, propoſed. A threefold ſubſerviency thereof to their imbracement of the Covenant, as they grow up to years of Maturity, ſhewed. Firſt, Such Pre-ingagements as would obſtruct that their imbracement of the Covenant are obviated and prevented. What Pre-ingagements Children are ſubject to. The ſpring of them diſcovered. How obviated by the Application of the Token, declared. Secondly, Their imbracement of the Covenant by the Application of
the Token ſubſerved by way of Obligation. The ſeveral Obligations that the Seed of Believers are under, as bearing the Token of the Covenant, to imbrace the Covenant, opened. Thirdly, The ſame end ſubſerved by the Application of the Token of the Covenant by way of Encouragement. What Encouragements the Seed of Believers have to imbrace the Covenant, ſhewed.

    _ CHAP. X. The third grand Queſtion propoſed. The duty of Parents towards their Children reduced to two Heads. Their duty to be performed immediately and directly towards them again reduced to two Heads. What they are to teach and inſtruct them in and about: As alſo what means they are to uſe for the rendring. Inſtructions given them, opened. Some rules for their right management of them in the performance of their duty, laid down. Their duty to be performed immediately towards God on the behalf of their Children, ſhewed. Some Motives to preſs them to a faithful performance of their duty, urged.

    _ CHAP. XI. The fourth grand Queſtion propoſed. The improvement that the Seed of Believers may and ought to make of their Covenant ſtate, as ratified by the Application of the Token of the Covenant, opened in four particulars. That great Queſtion, how long the Covenantſtate of the Seed of Believers is continued to them upon their Parents account, anſwered
ſo far as is neceſſary to prevent ſuch fears as either Parents or Children are ſubject to, as to the forfeiture of their Covenant-ſtate in their Child-hood.
